## Appearance

Beam possesses the body of a muscular young man and as a fiend his shark's snout and fin replace of the top half of his head; he has no visible eyes. He has short, spiky black hair and very sharp teeth.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg3-1) He exclusively wears swimming trunks.

When he partially transforms into his devil form, his head becomes a massive shark's head with three pairs of eyes. In his full transformation, his entire body resembles a shark but with multiple sets of long fins that he uses as legs.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch49-2)

![Devil Form](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/chainsaw-man/images/d/db/Beam%27s_Shark_form.png "Beam's Shark form.png")

Devil Form

## Personality

Beam is very eccentric, naive and innocent. He often goes along with Denji's plans no matter how crazy they are due to having a lot of respect for the Chainsaw Devil.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch49Pg11_-_21-3) His devotion to the Chainsaw Man is such that he always tries to protect Denji personally and will offer his blood to revive him, even if ends up severely hurting or killing him.

He is shown to greatly enjoy fighting, eagerly diving into packs of zombies and eating them.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg3_-_4-4)

Though he was greatly afraid of having to fight against [Bomb](/reze "Reze") to the point of fleeing, he showed no hesitation in trying to fight back against her when cornered.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch45Pg3_-_9-5)

## Plot

### [Katana Man arc](/katana-man-arc "Katana Man arc")

Beam is among the fighters from the Special Division 4 that are tasked with invading [Akane Sawatari](/akane-sawatari "Akane Sawatari")'s hideout. He emerges from the wall below ground and dives into the pack of zombies, partially transforming his head into a shark's head and kills several of them with ease.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg3_-_4-4) He almost accidentally bites through the [Violence Fiend](/violence-fiend "Violence Fiend") but is punched back by him and reverts to his original self.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg5-6)

After [Power](/power "Power") drinks too much blood in the attack on [Akane Sawatari](/akane-sawatari "Akane Sawatari")'s hideout and has to be taken away temporarily, Beam is assigned to be [Denji](/denji "Denji")'s partner at his own request.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch39Pg1_-_2-7) He is very happy to be partnered with Denji and calls him Lord Chainsaw continuously while Makima introduces him to Denji.[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch39Pg3_-_4-8)

### [Bomb Girl arc](/bomb-girl-arc "Bomb Girl arc")

He follows Denji around by swimming through the floor when they're out on patrol and is overjoyed when it rains. Denji tells him to stay out of sight because he'll cause a scene otherwise.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Ch40Pg1_-_5-9)

He intervenes to save Denji when Reze attacks him on their date. As soon as he jumps away with Denji he realizes that [Reze](/reze "Reze") is the [Bomb Devil](/bomb-devil "Bomb Devil") [hybrid](/hybrid "Hybrid") by her smell. Reze transforms and quickly catches up to him and Denji.[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch44Pg11_-_19-10)

He tries to dodge her attacks to no avail and is blasted back by her explosions.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Ch45Pg1_-_2-11) He tries attacking her with his shark head attack but she quickly defeats him with a point-blank explosion. Before Reze can finish him off he quickly escapes with Denji as a group of civilian devil hunters briefly distract her.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch45Pg3_-_9-5) He takes Denji to an Anti-Devil 2nd Division Training Center and informs Aki about the Bomb Devil, stating that she is the Gun Devil's ally. When Aki questions him on how he knows this Beam claims he can't explain because Makima would kill him. Reze appears outside the building and Beam warns Aki that she's arrived.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Ch45Pg13_-_15-12)

They try to escape by car but Reze swiftly catches up to them.[\[13\]](#cite_note-Ch46Pg18_-_21-13)

After Denji is defeated by Reze, Beam and the Angel Devil restore him by feeding him blood. Beam reveals how the [Chainsaw Devil](/chainsaw-devil "Chainsaw Devil") used to move around in the past by using his chainsaw chain to navigate buildings. Denji makes Beam transform into his full shark form and mounts him, using his chainsaw chains like reins instead of how Beam recommended. They move in to attack Reze and the [Typhoon Devil](/typhoon-devil "Typhoon Devil") together.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch49Pg11_-_21-3)

They manage to wound Reze who recovers after drinking blood, and kill the [Typhoon Devil](/typhoon-devil "Typhoon Devil") after charging into his vortex and slashing him. Reze attacks from above and Beam puts Denji in his mouth to protect him, taking the brunt of the attack in exchange which incapacitates him.[\[14\]](#cite_note-Ch50Pg2_-_19-14)

After Denji dives into the water to defeat Reze, Beam later dives in after him and rescues both of them by taking them to the beach.[\[15\]](#cite_note-Ch51Pg6_-_11-15) When Reze breaks Denji's neck and leaves, Denji begs Beam to rev his engine and heal him.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Ch51Pg16_-_18-16)

### [International Assassins arc](/international-assassins-arc "International Assassins arc")

Beam assists Makima and the [Spider Devil](/spider-devil "Spider Devil") in cleaning up several doll puppets controlled by [Santa Claus](/santa-claus "Santa Claus"). Makima states she'll continue to clean up the situation and orders Beam to go assist Denji which he enthusiastically agrees to.[\[17\]](#cite_note-Ch59Pg5_-_6-17)

He appears in the department store where the fight is underway and rescues Denji from being pinned by [Long](/long "Long") by bashing her in the back with his oversized shark head. He roars at her not touch 'Lord Chainsaw' and he retreats with Denji.[\[18\]](#cite_note-Ch62Pg8_-_10-18) Beam advises Denji not to use his chainsaws so that he can save up his blood, but he trips over a doll's body as they're fleeing. Denji calls him out on being clumsy but winces in pain as he stands on a nail; this triggers the [Curse Devil](/curse-devil "Curse Devil") who picks up Denji and causes him to begin bleeding profusely. Beam watches this in shock until [Tolka](/tolka "Tolka"), who had been hidden nearby, stands up and kicks Beam in the face.[\[19\]](#cite_note-Ch62Pg14_-_19-19)

Beam is knocked unconscious by Tolka's attack and is dragged to Hell alongside everybody else in the department store once Tolka's master turns him into a perfect doll and summons the [Hell Devil](/hell-devil "Hell Devil").[\[20\]](#cite_note-Ch63Pg1_-_19-20)

When he wakes up, Beam senses the presence of the [Darkness Devil](/darkness-devil "Darkness Devil") and panics alongside the other fiends as it approaches them.[\[21\]](#cite_note-Ch64Pg7-21) As the Darkness Devil arrives, it cuts off Beam's arms along with the arms of every other person present.[\[22\]](#cite_note-Ch64Pg12_-_14-22)

As the Darkness Devil begins slaughtering all of the humans, fiends and devils present, Beam picks himself up and feeds blood from his stumps into Denji's mouth. He pulls on Denji's chainsaw cord to revive him and begs him to grant their wish, moments before the Darkness Devil points in his direction and cuts Beam into pieces, killing him instantly.[\[23\]](#cite_note-Ch65Pg4_-_6-23)

### [Control Devil arc](/control-devil-arc "Control Devil arc")

Beam is mentioned during the news broadcast by an interviewed woman who said she saw Denji riding him during the fight with the [Typhoon Devil](/typhoon-devil "Typhoon Devil").[\[24\]](#cite_note-Ch89Pg9-24)

## Abilities

As a [fiend](/fiend "Fiend"), Beam can't make [contracts](/contract "Contract") and his powers are considerably weaker than those of his devil form. However, he still has all the other standard [devil abilities](/devil#general-abilities "Devil").

### Physical Abilities

-   **Enhanced Durability**: Beam is very durable for a fiend, able to survive point-blank explosions caused by [Bomb Girl](/reze "Reze") multiple times and still have enough mobility to escape afterwards.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch49Pg11_-_21-3)[\[14\]](#cite_note-Ch50Pg2_-_19-14)

### Devil Powers

-   **Intangibility**: Beam has the ability to swim through solid objects, allowing him to pass through walls and the floor with ease.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg3-1) He doesn't seem to able to bring others with him or bring large objects through.

-   **Devil Transformation**: Beam can transform his head into an enormous shark's head with multiple eyes and great biting power.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg3_-_4-4) With his full transformation, Beam's entire body transforms into his Shark Devil form.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch49-2)

### Other Abilities

-   **Enhanced Smell:** Fitting for a shark fiend, Beam has a strong sense of smell. He was able to recognize and correctly assume that Reze was a Bomb Devil hybrid based on her scent.

## Trivia

-   His name is originated from **Cherubim** (ケルビム _Kerubimu_), an angel from the highest order of Christian [angelic hierarchy](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?Hierarchy_of_angels "wiki:Hierarchy of angels") along with Seraphim and Thrones.
    -   Other followers of Chainsaw Man were Power, [Angel Devil](/angel-devil "Angel Devil"), [Galgali](/galgali "Galgali"), [Princi](/princi "Princi"), **Seraphim**, **Dominion** and **Virtue**.
    -   Cherubs were originally depicted as humanoids with several feet and four heads of different creatures/animals including a that of man but would later on take the more famous baby-like and innocent appearance. Beam is a fiend who visually looks like a human and animal mix along with being able to go in his full devil form both fully and partially, usually seen partially at the head. He also possesses four fins similar to how cherubs have four feet. It is also likely his personality being very naïve and infantile is a reference to the more common depiction of cherubs as childlike beings.
-   Beam's rankings in the [Popularity Polls](/popularity-polls "Popularity Polls") are as follows:
    -   Beam ranked 12th in the First Popularity Poll with 5,847 votes.
    -   Beam ranked 12th in the Second Popularity Poll with 17,741 votes.

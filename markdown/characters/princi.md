## Appearance

Princi resembles a young woman with waist-length black hair. She has eight legs ending in scythe-like curved points which are sharp enough to stab through flesh. She appears to have a zipper in the center of her face with the pull under her chin to unzip upwards.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg8-1)

She normally wears a shirt and elaborate bow-tie with a knee-length skirt.

## Personality

Princi usually takes a human shape so she tends to be friendly to humans and works as a devil hunter herself. She is shown to have a polite, docile and proper personality however she will still kill people for just looking at her the wrong way.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg8-1)

She showed no reaction at being mistaken for a human by the [Violence Fiend](/violence-fiend "Violence Fiend") and impassively killed zombies without any change in expression.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg7_-_8-2) She was bold enough to attack the Darkness Devil directly and showed no expression after being mutilated. She's also extremely devoted to Makima and will follow her orders directly, even if she has personal qualms with them.

## Plot

### [Katana Man arc](/katana-man-arc "Katana Man arc")

The Spider Devil is among the forces of the Special Division 4 that raid the hideout of [Akane Sawatari](/akane-sawatari "Akane Sawatari"). She is briefly mistaken for a human by the [Violence Fiend](/violence-fiend "Violence Fiend") before revealing her true nature by slaughtering several zombies with her scythe-like legs.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg7_-_8-2)

### [International Assassins arc](/international-assassins-arc "International Assassins arc")

The Spider Devil assists [Makima](/makima "Makima") and [Beam](/beam "Beam") in cleaning up several doll puppets controlled by [Santa Claus](/santa-claus "Santa Claus"). Makima states she'll continue to clean up the situation and orders Princi to extract [Denji](/denji "Denji") no matter what devils Santa Claus throws their way which Princi acknowledges. Makima also orders Princi to recover any corpses from their own people who will die in the upcoming fights.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch59Pg5_-_7-3)

Princi emerges from the ground in Hell after most of the devil hunters there have been killed or incapacitated by the [Darkness Devil](/darkness-devil "Darkness Devil"). She attempts to stab him with her many legs but the Darkness Devil reacts in time to fling her backwards and sever most of her limbs. Makima realizes that the Darkness Devil is baiting her to come and save the remaining fighters in Hell and despite Princi requesting that she stay away, Makima orders Princi to summon her there. Makima emerges from Princi's body which unzips and after Makima tricks the [Hell Devil](/hell-devil "Hell Devil") into bringing them back, Princi is transported back to Earth.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch66Pg3_-_13-4)

### [Control Devil arc](/control-devil-arc "Control Devil arc")

She is last seen, limbless, as one of the many people being controlled by Makima. Given how her limbs have not regenerated but her entire body was split when she was unzipped, it is unknown if she automatically got zipped back up or if Makima manually put her back together herself.

## Abilities

As a Devil, the Spider Devil possesses all of the standard [devil abilities](/devil#general-abilities "Devil"). As the embodiment of fear of spiders, Princi does whatever a spider can; she can walk upon walls, and has spider limbs which she can pierce enemies with.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg8-1)[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch59Pg5_-_7-3)

### Physical Prowess

-   **Enhanced Strength**: Princi is strong enough to kill zombies with a single strike.

### Devil Powers

-   **Intangibility**: Princi has been shown to submerge herself under the ground and emerge again to attack her foes at any given time.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch66Pg3-5)
-   **Summoning**: Princi has shown that she can unfurl the zipper on her body to summon Makima to her immediate location even in Hell.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch66Pg5_-_7-6) It is not known if she can summon anybody or only Makima as it is shown that she and Makima can communicate directly even though the former is in Hell.

## Trivia

-   Princi's rankings in the [Popularity Polls](/popularity-polls "Popularity Polls") are as follows:
    -   Princi ranked 27th in the First Popularity Poll with 761 votes.
    -   Princi ranked 34th in the Second Popularity Poll with 1,024 votes.
-   Her name comes from **Principality** (_リンシパリティ Purinshipariti_), an angel from the lowest order of Christian angelic hierarchy along with Archangels and Angels. Alternative names of the Principality rank for angels are also Princedoms and Rulers.
    -   [Angel Devil](/angel-devil "Angel Devil") is also another follower of [Chainsaw Man](/pochita "Pochita") along with Beam, [Galgali](/galgali "Galgali"), **Dominion**, [Power](/power "Power"), **Seraphim** and **Virtue** also serving him.
    -   The role of the Principality angels is to guide and protect nations, or groups of peoples, and institutions such as the Church as well as preside over the bands of angels and charge them with fulfilling the divine ministry. This could serve as a reference to her nature of being an obedient subordinate to Makima, a devil who is the embodiment of control and order that works for the government. She is often told by her to handle out tasks such as watching over people and cleaning things up, like the corpses of the fallen. She, as well as Beam, were told to watch over Chainsaw Man and fully complied.
-   She is often called **Prinz** in some translations, which is most likely a mistranslation.

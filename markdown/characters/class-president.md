## Appearance

The class president was a high school girl of average height and build. She had short light-colored hair that did not reach her shoulders with a hair clip.

Her contract with the Justice Devil allows her to transform into a towering, blob-like creature supported by two giant hands, with her lower body protruding from the bottom and hanging in the hair, and multiple replicas of her face at the top.

## Personality

Originally, she appeared to be mild-mannered and supportive, such as when she sought out and consoled [Asa Mitaka](/asa-mitaka "Asa Mitaka") after their class was given [Bucky](/bucky "Bucky"). In reality, she was delusional, presumptuous and narcissistic, believing that Asa was having a sexual relationship with their teacher, [Mr. Tanaka](/tanaka "Tanaka"), whom she herself had been having a sexual relationship with.

It is possible that, just like with [Yuko](/yuko "Yuko"), her personality got warped by the Justice Devil and that her original personality was quite different.

## Abilities

### Devil Contracts

**Justice Devil Contract**: The class president had a contract with the [Justice Devil](/justice-devil "Justice Devil") for an unknown price. This contract granted her super strength and super speed in combination with a transformed form with claws and tentacles. This would make her the second character to have a devil [transformation](/contract#devil-transformation "Contract").

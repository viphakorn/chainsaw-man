First Incarnation

## Personality

The Typhoon Devil is subservient and respectful towards [Reze](/reze "Reze") and willingly cooperates with her for its own protection.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch43Pg16-2)

## Plot

### [Bomb Girl arc](/bomb-girl-arc "Bomb Girl arc")

In a disused bathroom the Typhoon Devil speaks with a serial killer than it has formed a contract with. The man wishes to know why the devils are so interested in getting the Chainsaw's heart. Instead of answering his question the Typhoon Devil tells him to be wary of the [human with Chainsaw's heart](/denji "Denji") as he has already killed many devils. The man refutes this as being the result of the devil's stupidity and told a story to the Typhoon Devil of how he killed a [devil hunter](/devil-hunter "Devil Hunter") in China by taking his wife and daughter hostage and torturing them.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch41Pg16_-_19-3)

The Typhoon Devil creates a storm to trap Denji and Reze within a school they were exploring at night. After the Typhoon Devil's man attempts to take Reze prisoner as a bargaining chip to use against Denji, Reze kills the man and identifies Typhoon Devil who explains it had no idea Reze was involved. Reze offers to forgive the Typhoon Devil if it obeys her for a while and removes the body.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch43Pg15_-_16-4)

Later as Reze prepared to battle both [Aki](/aki-hayakawa "Aki Hayakawa") and the [Violence Fiend](/violence-fiend "Violence Fiend"), the Typhoon Devil made a sudden appearance by crashing through a building near to them and announcing his arrival.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch49Pg8_-_9-5) As Denji entered the battle riding [Beam](/beam "Beam") the Typhoon Devil angrily recognized him and moved to battle him alongside Reze.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch49Pg19_-_21-6)

The Typhoon Devil lashed out with a tentacle but missed as Denji and Beam evaded his attack. When Reze's leg was cut off by Denji the Typhoon Devil spat out some blood for Reze to drink and regrow her missing limb.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch50Pg2_-_4-7) Beam then dashed into the center of the Typhoon Devil's swirling storm of brain matter allowing Denji to cut him apart by swinging his chainsaws around. The Typhoon Devil's body collapsed into a pile of brain matter after Denji finished cutting through his head, killing him.[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch50Pg13_-_16-8)

### [Justice Devil arc](/justice-devil-arc "Justice Devil arc")

In a flashback, it is revealed that the Typhoon Devil destroyed [Asa Mitaka](/asa-mitaka "Asa Mitaka")'s home and killed her entire family.

## Abilities

As a Devil, the Typhoon Devil possesses all of the standard [devil abilities](/devil#general-abilities "Devil"). In exchange for the heart of the Chainsaw Devil, the Typhoon Devil accepted to grant an assassin use of its power for life[\[9\]](#cite_note-Ch41Pg18-9), however this contract did not realize due to the death of assassin.

### Physical Prowess

-   **Enhanced Strength**: The Typhoon Devil is extremely strong, he can destroy buildings just by running through them. The wind created by his spinning body is strong enough to make people and cars fly.

### Devil Powers

-   **Storm Creation**: Thanks to its body structure, the Typhoon Devil constantly generates a storm by spinning their gut-like bodily extensions. The storm is strong enough to destroy buildings and make cars fly through the air. The Typhoon Devil can also create rainstorms which it used to trap Denji and Reze within a phone cabinet and later school.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch43Pg16-2)
-   **Water Communication**: The Typhoon Devil can manifest itself as a swirling drain of water for long-distance communication.[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch41Pg17-10) It is still able to perform contracts with this form.

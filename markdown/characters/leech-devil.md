## Appearance

The Leech Devil has a large wrinkled body with four legs and two tentacle-like arms. Her limbs are tipped with circular orifices like a leech and her face consists entirely of a single large mouth with blocky teeth. In the colored manga she is yellowish but in the anime she has more realistic dark leech colors. She has long black hair, and three pairs of udder-like glands.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch9Pg14-1)

## Personality

The Leech Devil, like most devils, has a great hatred for humans. She cared deeply for the [Bat Devil](/bat-devil "Bat Devil"), referring to him affectionately and trying to avenge him after his death. She and the Bat Devil shared a dream of devouring all humans together.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch10Pg4-2) Despite her relationship with him however, she seemed willing to spare [Denji](/denji "Denji") purely because he has a cute face.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch9Pg17-3)

## Plot

### History

At some point the Leech Devil became the girlfriend of the Bat Devil.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch9Pg17-3)

### [Bat Devil arc](/bat-devil-arc "Bat Devil arc")

After Denji slays the Bat Devil and begins celebrating the chance to touch [Power](/power "Power")'s chest, the Leech Devil appears and blasts a hole through Denji's forearm, severing his hand. The Leech Devil picks up Denji's hand and eats it.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch9Pg11_-_15-4)

Denji pulled his chainsaw cord in an attempt to transform but his chainsaw only partially emerges from his head due to his lack of blood. The Leech Devil briefly considers letting Denji go but after he refuses to run due to protecting Power and [Meowy](/meowy "Meowy"), the Leech Devil starts to fight him.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch9Pg15_-_19-5)

The two of them exchange blows and deal damage to each other with the Leech Devil lamenting that her boyfriend was killed by a boy with such sleazy desires. Denji retorts that their desires are worth less than his since he will beat them in a "dream battle". The Leech Devil eventually gains the upper hand, skewering Denji with her tongue.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch10Pg1_-_11-6) As she prepares to eat him, [Aki Hayakawa](/aki-hayakawa "Aki Hayakawa") appears and summons the [Fox Devil](/fox-devil "Fox Devil") over the Leech Devil's head, decapitating her instantly.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch10Pg12_-_15-7) The Fox Devil happily swallows the Leech Devil's head before disappearing in a puff of smoke.[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch10Pg16-8)

## Abilities

As a Devil, the Leech Devil possesses all of the standard [devil abilities](/devil#general-abilities "Devil"). Besides those, it is shown that the Leech Devil's tongue was strong enough to pierce Denji's torso with ease. [\[9\]](#cite_note-Ch10-9)

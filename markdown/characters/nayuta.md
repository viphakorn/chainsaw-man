> "_[The Control Devil](/control-devil "Control Devil") could only form relationships through the power of fear. So she always longed for something like a family. That's the kind of world she wanted to create. So [you](/denji "Denji") create that world for her, okay? Give her lots of hugs._" ― [Pochita](/pochita "Pochita") telling Denji the Control Devil's dream

**Nayuta** (ナユタ, _****Nayuta****_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")) is the reincarnation of the **[Control Devil](/control-devil "Control Devil")** (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>支</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>し</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>配</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>はい</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> の<ruby lang="ja"><rb>悪</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>あく</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>魔</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ま</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _Shihai no Akuma_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")) following [Makima](/makima "Makima")'s death.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch97-1) To prevent her from becoming similar to her previous incarnation, she was taken by [Kishibe](/kishibe "Kishibe") to be raised by [Denji](/denji "Denji") as Denji's younger sister. She is a recurring character in the [Academy Saga](/academy-saga "Academy Saga").

## Appearance

![Nayuta](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/chainsaw-man/images/7/7f/Nayuta.png "Nayuta.png")

[](/file:nayuta.png)

Nayuta's First Appearance.

Nayuta takes the appearance of a young girl with dark (dark brown in colored manga), shoulder-cut hair with a single large bang that hangs in front of her face, as well as a mole under her left eye. Similar to Makima and [Yoru](/yoru "Yoru"), her eyes are yellow with multiple red-colored rings within them.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch97-1)

In the [Academy Saga](/academy-saga "Academy Saga"), she is taller and visibly more mature, but still appears to be young. Her hair has grown longer and is woven into a braid flung over her shoulder in a fashion similar to that of Makima. In addition, she retains the long bang from her childhood which covers her left eye.

## Personality

> " _**Denji**: Nayuta! What did you do?!_
> 
> _**Nayuta**: Turned [her](/asa-mitaka "Asa Mitaka") into a dog._
> 
> _**Denji**: Why?!_
> 
> _**Nayuta**: Cuz she put spit on my property!_ "
> 
> ― [Chapter 120](/chapter-120 "Chapter 120")

Denji describes her as a "huge-problem child with an extreme personality". As a humanoid Devil, she has a natural inclination towards humans. Just like her previous incarnation, Nayuta seems to like dogs, as seen by her getting along with Makima's dogs.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch97-1) However, unlike Makima, Nayuta does not seem to be controlling the dogs using her ability.

Nayuta is protective of Denji, wanting him to break off his relationship with [Asa Mitaka](/asa-mitaka "Asa Mitaka") as every woman he met tried to kill him. She seems to be very demanding, holds peace signs, and wants ice cream every day. Denji describes her as very smart.

Personality-wise, she bears little resemblance to Makima. Despite referring to Denji as her property, she does seem to care very much for him. She acts very similar to Denji, as she has picked up many of his mannerisms from being raised by him. Nayuta has taken on Denji's informal way of speaking, and even laughs like Denji. She is also well-spoken at times. When first introduced, she was taciturn and very blunt when she spoke, but upon spending time living with Denji, she has become outgoing and talkative. She is shown to be very impish and mischievous, turning Yoru into a "dog" with her mind controlling powers and alters her and Asa's memories. Like Makima, she is able to perceive people using scent, getting a bad scent from Yoru and the [Falling Devil](/falling-devil "Falling Devil"). However, she does not seem to bear malicious intent, having only wanted to protect Denji in case he had made a bad decision. She has a personality befitting a human of her appeared age, and can act childish and argumentative with Denji. As he implied from Nayuta being smart enough to go to college, she also acts very precocious as well.

Nayuta has a rather amoral personality, where much of her morality is based on her own personal preferences. When Fami revealed a prophecy which would spell the end of humanity and the rise of devils, Nayuta found it to be very fun. But when Fami noted this would mean the end of modern conveniences like pizza and Chinese food, she immediately changed her mind. Nayuta also refused to help Fami since she was busy with school, demonstrating how seriously she takes her education and how she's unwilling to help others if it gets in the way of her life.

## Abilities

As the Control Devil, Nayuta has the same powers as [Makima](/makima "Makima"), as shown when she is able to use the chain link ability. She also has all the standard [Devil abilities](/devil#general-abilities "Devil").

-   **Memory Alteration:** Nayuta can erase someone's memories and plant false ones into their head. That ability can be used on both humans, and Devils, including Fiends.
-   **Perception Alteration:** Nayuta can change someone's perception of senses, like taste. That ability can be used on Devils.

## Etymology

-   The name **[Nayuta](https://www.behindthename.com/name/nayuta/submitted)** is written in katakana (ナユタ), which has no special meaning.

## Trivia

-   Nayuta is named and designed after the protagonist of a one-shot written by [Fujimoto](/tatsuki-fujimoto "Tatsuki Fujimoto"), _Yogen no Nayuta_.
    -   In the one-shot Nayuta has a brother who takes care of her by the name of Kenji which is obviously similar to the name Denji.
-   Nayuta's rankings in the [Popularity Polls](/popularity-polls "Popularity Polls") are as follows:
    -   Nayuta ranked 18th in the Second Popularity Poll with 4,530 votes.
-   Nayuta has the leashes of the dogs tied around her belt, similar to where Makima used her chains.
-   Both Nayuta and Denji own plants, and while Denji's plant is flourished, Nayuta's seems to be growing poorly at best, and dying or unwell at worst.
-   Another parallel between Nayuta and Denji is their development. Both were content with basic food like sliced bread, only to become more demanding as time went on.

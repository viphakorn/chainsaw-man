## Appearance

Haruka is a slim young man who wears a bandana, an all-black uniform, and a military cap with a symbol. He has black hair combed to the side of his face. He has a pull cord in his chest identical to that of [Pochita](/pochita "Pochita")'s in [Denji](/denji "Denji")'s chest, later revealed to be a surgical implant.

## Personality

Haruka seems to be benevolent and prideful on a surface level; he has a habit of constantly introducing himself in an extravagant manner and he holds his position as president of both the student council and the Devil Hunter Club in high regard. As of such, he tends to lead those around him, instructing others on how to handle a situation, utilizing their skillset to their advantage.

However, he can also be very demeaning to those he views as having no worth to the club, such as when he berates Asa for accidentally destroying her phone when she tried to help out. It's also shown that he can be fairly manipulative, lying to others that he is indeed the real [Chainsaw Man](/chainsaw-man "Chainsaw Man"), likely in order to boost his own popularity. However, when cornered in the aquarium he easily admits that his ripcord is simply a surgical implant and reveals himself to simply be a massive fan of the Chainsaw Man, crying and calling out to him for help.

## History

### [Dating Denji arc](/dating-denji-arc "Dating Denji arc")

The day after [Yuko](/yuko "Yuko")'s attack on the school, he introduces himself to [Asa Mitaka](/asa-mitaka "Asa Mitaka"). He tells Asa that she is accepted into the Devil Hunter Club. [Yoru](/yoru "Yoru") takes over and asks Haruka if he knows Chainsaw Man's identity. Haruka reveals a pull-cord sticking out of his chest; believing he is Chainsaw Man, Yoru walks away. At the aquarium, Denji and Asa ran into members of the Devil Hunter Club including Haruka, Seigi, and [Kobeni Higashiyama's](/kobeni-higashiyama "Kobeni Higashiyama") brother, who were patrolling the aquarium for devils. Asa ponders whether she should turn Denji into a weapon or kill Haruka, who she believes is Chainsaw Man. They are able to exploit the endless confines of the aquarium by obtaining water from repeating rooms and fish to eat. Asa realizes she still has her mother's phone, and tries to get a cellular reception, but breaks the phone after she trips and falls.

As Asa lays on the floor, staring into space, Haruka tells her that if she didn't broken her mother's cellphone when she tripped, the others would've had the ability to escape the aquarium. Feeling insulted, she reminds Haruka that he claimed to be [Chainsaw Man](/chainsaw-man "Chainsaw Man") and that he should be doing something to help. Haruka becomes confused, asking what she's talking about, to which she reminds him about the starter on his chest. Haruka reveals that the starter on his chest is actually a surgical implant, and that he got it because he's just a massive fan. Asa, in disbelief, asks him to confirm that he isn't the actual Chainsaw man, to which Haruka breaks down laughing, begging Chainsaw Man to save him, much to Asa's horror.

After Asa destroys the aquarium and Yoru defeats the [Eternity Devil](/eternity-devil "Eternity Devil") who had trapped them there, the Devil Hunter Club members are stunned, with Haruka theorising aloud as to who Asa truly is. Later a nearby Haruka is shown spying on Denji and Asa from a distance, likely still curious about Asa's powers and fully believing Denji's words that Asa could die if Denji took her to his home.

## Trivia

-   The kanji used in Haruka's surname are part of one spelling for the [Japanese Spiny Lobster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_spiny_lobster), (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>伊</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>い</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>勢</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>せ</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>海</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>え</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>老</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>び</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _ise-ebi_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")). However, when read more literally it can translate to "**The One Ocean Energy**" or "**The One Ocean Force**"

## Appearance

Aldo is a man of average height with short black hair and light colored eyes. He also has two vertical scars crossing his right eye.

## Personality

Unlike his brothers, Aldo is actually a very sensitive person. He's someone easily scared by the deaths of other people, being his common reaction to puke once he saw a corpse. He also empathizes with the person he was acting as, to the point of crying once he learned about his life.

He tends to be someone very insecure and constantly tells himself "he's immortal and can do it". This reaches the point that, for most of the arc, everyone believes he's just a civvie instead of an important hitman.

Despite his flaws, Aldo is also someone very determined and intelligent. Some fans believe he wasn't actually an infected doll, but rather he was acting as such to escape. He tends to think before acting, at least when he tried to attack Denji. He motivates himself by the words of his brothers, who he admires deeply.

Overall, Aldo acts as a coward and acts only when he thinks the situation is safe, or will decide to step back temporally until then.

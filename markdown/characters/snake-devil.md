## Personality

The Snake Devil's personality is currently unknown.

## Plot

### [Katana Man arc](/wiki/Katana_Man_arc "Katana Man arc")

As the Katana Man is being overwhelmed by [Himeno](/wiki/Himeno "Himeno") and the [Ghost Devil](/wiki/Ghost_Devil "Ghost Devil"), he calls out to Sawatari for help. She raises her arm and summons the Snake Devil, commanding it to swallow the Ghost Devil whole. The Snake Devil instantly appears and swallows the Ghost Devil's body, decapitating it.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch25Pg9_-_13-2)

Later as Sawatari and Katana Man attempted to escape with a captive [Denji](/wiki/Denji "Denji"), [Kobeni](/wiki/Kobeni "Kobeni") appeared. Sawatari commanded the Snake Devil to attack with its tail but Kobeni's incredible agility allowed to avoid the attack and close the distance between them.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch28Pg4_-_6-3)

As the Special Division 4 invades Sawatari's headquarters she commands the Snake Devil to spit out the Ghost Devil which now fights on their side.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg17_-_19-4) After Aki defeats the Ghost Devil, Sawatari attempts to summons the Snake Devil in a panic but she is stopped by Kobeni.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch35Pg17_-_19-5)

The Snake Devil soon after killed Sawatari as she was being arrested, possibly as a cause in their contract together.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch38Pg18-6)

### [Control Devil arc](/wiki/Control_Devil_arc "Control Devil arc")

By proxy of possessing Akane Sawatari, Makima had access to her contract with the Snake Devil.

## Abilities

As a Devil, the Snake Devil possesses all of the standard [devil abilities](/wiki/Devil#General_Abilities "Devil"), such the ability to make contracts with humans for a price.

The only known contract is the one with [Akane Sawatari](/wiki/Akane_Sawatari "Akane Sawatari"). In exchange for sacrificing one fingernail for every command, Sawatari is able to summon the Snake Devil completely and use its ability to absorb beings by saying "**Swallow it whole**" (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>丸</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>まる</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>飲</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>の</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> み, _Marunomi_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")) and later on release them back by saying "**Spit it out**" (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>吐</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>は</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> き<ruby lang="ja"><rb>出</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>だ</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> し, _Hakidashi_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets"))[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg17-7) which caused her nose to bleed. With this power, Sawatari has been shown to revive the Katana-Man, and control the Ghost Devil to fight on its behalf. Sawatari is also able to summon the tail of the Snake Devil by saying "**Tail**" (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>尻</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>しっ</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>尾</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ぽ</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _Shippo_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")). To use the abilities of Snake Devil, Sawatari requires hand motions, thus when her hands are held together, she cannot use the abilities.

### Devil Powers

-   **Absorption and Release**: The Snake Devil can devour other devils with its gigantic mouth and then expel them at a later point to fight on its behalf. Doing so any being that is released is fully healed and can fight in place of the Snake Devil.[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch25Pg11_-_13-8)

Hybrid Form

## Personality

The Longsword Hybrid's real personality is currently unknown, as he was brainwashed and mind-controlled by Makima. From the few bits of his dialogue, he makes it clear that he wants to impress Makima in the group's first operation.

## Plot

### [Control Devil arc](/control-devil-arc "Control Devil arc")

At an unknown point in time, the Longsword Hybrid was brainwashed by Makima to serve her needs. He is summoned as part of Makima's newly-formed [Special Division 5](/tokyo-special-division-5 "Tokyo Special Division 5"), a team of weapon hybrids created for the sole purpose of battling the fully-powered [Chainsaw Devil](/chainsaw-devil "Chainsaw Devil").[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch86Pg14-15-1) While under Makima's control, the Longsword Hybrid tells the others that he wants to impress Makima on the group's first operation.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch86Pg16-2)

Once Makima commands Special Division 5 to attack, each member activates their weapon trigger, transforming into their Hybrid forms. They all leap from their respective spots to lunge straight towards Chainsaw Man. Before any of the Hybrids can land a single blow on him, they are blown back by Chainsaw Man leaping forward as he slices through Quanxi and the Longsword Hybrid with one of his chainsaw legs.

The three crash through several skyscrapers before landing in an apartment complex. As he gets up, Chainsaw Man kneels over Quanxi and the Longsword Hybrid's tattered bodies, clutching each of their severed heads before fighting the other Hybrids.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch87Pg4-14-3)

At some point in the future, Special Division 5's Hybrids are revived once more by Makima, who brings them all to a graveyard to confront Denji.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch93Pg12-13-4) Once Makima finishes monologuing her thoughts of erasing anything she dislikes to Pochita (who is disguised as Denji), the Longsword Hybrid and the other Weapon Humans transform into their Hybrid forms for the final battle.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch93Pg18-19-5) Pochita starts by slamming his fists into the ground, lifting up a huge chunk of the ground to throw straight towards Makima using his chains.

Katana Man and the Longsword Hybrid act first by leaping forward, both slicing the chunk of land and cutting it down into several dozen smaller chunks. However, the two are left vulnerable as Pochita falls towards them from behind the debris. Before the two Hybrids can act any further, Pochita swiftly uses his chainsaws to cut them both, defeating them in the process.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch94Pg5-7-6)

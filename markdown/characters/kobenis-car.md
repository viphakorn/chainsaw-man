## Plot

### [International Assassins Arc](/international-assassins-arc "International Assassins arc")

Kobeni bought this car with her own money to chauffeur her family.

[Power](/power "Power") notices Kobeni's car and demands her for a ride before claiming that it is her own car that Kobeni stole. She then gets inside the driver's seat and threatens Kobeni into allowing her to drive, while reassuring her she has a driver's license, which she doesn't. Kobeni gets inside as well to try and stop Power but is unsuccessful, as the fiend rams the car straight into [Denji](/denji "Denji") and [Kurose](/kurose "Kurose"), killing the latter. Power immediately shifts the blame to Kobeni for the incident and unrepentantly calls Kobeni a murderer since the car belongs to her. However, Kurose's face then changed into another person's that does not look like Kurose at all. It is then revealed that Kurose's persona was taken by the elder brother of [Joey](/joey "Joey") and [Aldo](/aldo "Aldo"), who was planning to assassinate Denji. Power, after discovering that the one she crashed into and killed was an enemy, pridefully declares that she was the only one who saw through the assassin's disguise.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch57Pg1-15-1) Later, Kobeni kneels down by her car to inspect the damage and anxiously worries about how much will it cost to fix the dent.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch59Pg1-22-2)

Later on, inside the department store, Kobeni observes in horror as both [Kishibe](/kishibe "Kishibe") and [Aldo](/aldo "Aldo") land on top of her car, crushing the roof in and leaving her in shock.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch62Pg1-7-3)

## Appearance

### Human Form

Reze appears to be a young woman or girl, and is of slender build. She has shoulder-length purple hair and emerald-green eyes. She is shown to be prone to blushing heavily. While posing as a civilian, she is seen wearing a choker in order to conceal the grenade pin in her neck, which she uses to transform.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch40Pg10-1)

In her debut appearance, she wore a loose shirt with stylized drawing of a bell on the front, and a backpack.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch40Pg10-1) When she visited a school with Denji she wore a plain white shirt and shorts. While working at the café Crossroads she wears an apron.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch40Pg13-2)

During her time as one of [Makima](/makima "Makima")'s brainwashed servants, Reze wore the [Public Safety Devil Hunter](/devil-hunter "Devil Hunter") uniform, consisting of the usual dress shirt, tie, and black pants. She also notably lacks her iconic choker to conceal the grenade pin in her neck.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch86Pg18-3)

### Hybrid Form

As the Bomb Hybrid, Reze's transformation is that of an atomic bomb, mostly reminiscent of the [Fat Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Man "wikipedia:Fat Man") atomic bomb which exploded over Nagasaki in the last moments of the Second World War. Consistent with other hybrid transformations, her teeth are always visible and are notably sharp and angular.

Bomb fuses cover her arms like sleeves while also making up a portion of her apron along with sticks of dynamite. Her clothes vary during her attempt to retrieve Denji. At first she still wears her normal clothes, then gets completely naked except for her dynamite apron and then she puts on panties off-screen.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch44Pg16-4)

Reze's Bomb Hybrid Form.

## Personality

When introduced, Reze initially appears to be a kind and gentle girl who has a crush on [Denji](/denji "Denji") soon after meeting him, taking interest in him at first sight and was portrayed to be as somewhat enthusiastic, as shown when both Denji and her have a drink of coffee at the Café she had worked at. She is shown to be laughing at his jokes and isn't afraid to get close and intimate with him.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch40Pg16_-_19-5)

Reze is also shown to be a bit of a tantalizer, teasing Denji on some occasions, such as when she had seen how he forced himself to drink the coffee and teased him for being "such a kid," While also displaying a rather sympathetic side to her, showing her concern about Denji never attending school as a child or in his current position. She shows little respect towards the owner of the café she works at, calling him a cheapskate for docking her pay.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch40Pg13-2)

This was later revealed to be just a façade in order to get her closer to Denji; even her seemingly true reactions like blushing in his presence were results of a harsh military training that Reze was subjected to from a young age.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch51Pg13-6) However, Reze had shown mercy towards Denji despite her mission, and at the end of the [Bomb Girl arc](/bomb-girl-arc "Bomb Girl arc"), Reze missed her train to meet Denji again at the café, to take his offer on running away with him.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch52Pg2-6-7)

Despite her fake crush on Denji, Reze somewhat reciprocated his feelings towards her, and felt similar to him since they had both never been to school. Although using more manipulative type of fighting, she seems to not enjoy killing or harming others and prefers to avoid it, unless it's necessary for her mission.[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch52Pg13-14-8)

## Abilities

### Physical Prowess

-   **Enhanced Strength**: Despite being a young girl, Reze has a great amount of physical strength; she could break an assassin's arm effortlessly and choke him to death, and with a simple knife she could cut cleanly through Denji's wrist in one swing.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Ch43Pg4_-_17-9)[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch44Pg1_-_10-10) She is also strong enough to bite Denji's tongue off and throw her own head with enough force to break a glass window.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Ch46Pg7-11)
-   **Enhanced Speed**: Reze could cut through Denji's throat before he could react and slice straight through Denji's wrist before he could pull his chainsaw cord.[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch44Pg1_-_10-10)

### Hybrid Powers

-   **Hybrid Transformation**: By pulling a pin on her neck, much like a grenade, Reze can cause herself to explode and transform into a hybrid form.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Ch44Pg14_-_16-12) She also can perform the same technique but instead of just transforming, she blows her head off and leaves the rest of her body as a decoy to distracted her opponents. This decoy can hold it's own head and throw it, the head then explodes just like a bomb and reveals a transformed Reze. The headless decoy body can be remotely controlled and act as a bomb, catching its target off-guard.
    -   **Augmented Durability**: Reze becomes drastically more durable in this form as she can withstand a full-power kick from the [Violence Fiend](/galgali "Galgali") without taking any damage.[\[13\]](#cite_note-Ch47Pg6_-_7-13) Her body can also withstand her own explosions without taking any damage and fall from the sky at immense velocity.[\[14\]](#cite_note-Ch48Pg10-14)
    -   **Explosion Creation**: After pulling the pin on her neck, Reze gains the ability to create explosions. The explosions are powerful enough to destroy vehicles, buildings and asphalt roads. Her explosions are also effective against other Devils, being capable of harming the [Shark Fiend](/beam "Beam") and Denji in his hybrid form. Besides that, Reze does not take any damage from her explosions, unless she desires, allowing her to use her powers without worrying about harming herself.
        -   **Explosive Propulsion**: By releasing explosions from her arms and legs, Reze can enhance her physical attacks and mobility with the explosive force from the blasts.[\[15\]](#cite_note-Ch44Pg18_-_19-15) She can also travel through the air by causing continuous and consecutive explosions, being capable of keeping up with cars.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Ch47Pg10_-_11-16)
            -   **Augmented Strength**: By infusing her attacks with explosive force, Reze's punches and kicks become more devastating. Her explosive unnamed attacks have also been shown to be powerful enough to destroy trucks and send Denji flying several feet into the air.[\[17\]](#cite_note-Ch48Pg1-17)[\[18\]](#cite_note-Ch48Pg6-8-18)
            -   **Augmented Speed**: Reze is able to use the explosive force created from her blasts to increase her movement speed. By releasing a massive explosion, Reze was able to send herself flying several feet into the air. She was also able to use her explosions to reach [Aki](/aki-hayakawa "Aki Hayakawa")'s car in a short period of time.[\[19\]](#cite_note-Ch47Pg2-19)[\[20\]](#cite_note-Ch46Pg19-21-20)
        -   **Explosive Spark**: By flicking her hands, Reze can release a spark which explodes upon impact. This attack serves as a long range projectile and is powerful enough to kill ordinary humans.[\[21\]](#cite_note-Ch45Pg7-8-21)[\[22\]](#cite_note-Ch46Pg13-22)
    -   **Self-Detonation**: Besides her ability to release explosions from her body, Reze also has the power to turn parts of her body into bombs. Unlike her normal explosions, which are more instantaneous, the explosive flesh behaves more like a remote bomb. The body parts that Reze losses by using them as explosives do not appear to cause her damage, since she is able to regrow them without needing to drink blood.
        -   **Torpedo Transformation**: Reze can transform her limbs into torpedoes, which makes her punches and kicks more devastating.[\[23\]](#cite_note-Ch48Pg9_-_11-23) Reze does not appear to suffer any damage from the detonation of her torpedo-like limbs.

-   **Blood Consumption**: As a hybrid, Reze is able to restore her health by consuming blood. After drinking blood from the Typhoon Devil she could regrow her severed leg instantly.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Ch50Pg2_-_4-24)
    -   **Nigh-Immortality**: Due to being a hybrid, Reze is immortal and nearly unkillable. She can survive being beheaded, bisected and take all kinds of injuries that would kill most devils. Even if she dies, as long as someone pulls her pin, Reze can come back to life in perfect condition.

### Skillset

-   **Knifemanship**: Reze is skilled at the use of knives. She could cut cleanly through Denji's wrist in one swing, before he could pull his chainsaw cord.[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch44Pg1_-_10-10)
-   **Hand-to-Hand Combat**: Reze is skilled in unarmed combat. In her normal human state she could expertly disarm and injure an assassin, outmaneuvering him completely by getting around him and putting him a stranglehold.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Ch43Pg4_-_17-9) She was also able to break Denji's neck without any effort, paralyzing him instantly.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Ch51Pg16-25)
-   **Bilingual**: Reze has demonstrated the ability to speak both Japanese and Russian.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Ch43Pg4_-_17-9)

## Weaknesses

-   **Water**: Reze can not use her explosion powers if she is wet, since the moisture prevents her from generating the necessary spark for her explosions.[\[26\]](#cite_note-Ch51Pg7-8-26)

## Trivia

-   Reze's rankings in the [Popularity Polls](/popularity-polls "Popularity Polls") are as follows:
    -   Reze ranked 4th in the First Popularity Poll with 19,079 votes.
    -   Reze ranked 5th in the Second Popularity Poll with 45,741 votes.
-   Her name is likely a reference to the word "raze," meaning to destroy or demolish.
-   Before Chainsaw Man was written, Tatsuki Fujimoto once had the idea of a story called Ibuki (イブキ _lit. Chinese juniper_) and the heroine of that story was named Reze.[\[27\]](#cite_note-:0-27)
    -   He has also claimed to be developing a story every night before sleep, which is also a story about Reze.
-   Tatsuki Fujimoto has stated the series _[JIN-ROH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin-Roh:_The_Wolf_Brigade "wikipedia:Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade")_ to be an influence for the [Bomb Girl Arc](/bomb-girl-arc "Bomb Girl arc"), being an animated film in which the story starts with the protagonist witnessing a girl committing an act of [suicide bombing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attack "wikipedia:Suicide attack").[\[27\]](#cite_note-:0-27)
    -   Interestingly enough, the way the bombing is depicted in the film closely resembles the way Reze activates her Bomb Devil powers.
-   One of the inspirations for Reze's creation was the [idea](https://entamebiyori.com/chainsawman-jumpfesta2022#i-16) of Denji meeting and falling in love with another woman besides Makima but then Makima would break them up.

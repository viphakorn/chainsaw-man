## Appearance

Galgali possesses the corpse of a fairly thin man and is dressed in a suit with a hood, and wears a plague doctor gas mask which covers his features.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg6-1) In the colored manga, Galgali's mask is colored in a very bright green, red and orange that looks like the colors of a parrot. In the anime, the mask has more muted colors, such as grey and beige, and some yellow.

When he doesn't have his plague doctor mask on, he becomes much taller, very muscular, has spiky black hair, and has 4 empty eyes.

Unmasked

## Personality

Despite his moniker as the Violence Fiend, he is extremely polite and straightforward. He apologized to [Beam](/beam "Beam") after hitting him in self-defense and told the [Spider Devil](/spider-devil "Spider Devil") to evacuate the area when he mistook her for a human lady.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg5_-_7-2)

Galgali attributes this to him still possessing a lot of his human's brain which is unusual for a fiend. He states that he loves peace and love, and remembers a lot of the details of "his former life as a human."[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch56Pg12_-_13-3)

He claims that he cannot eat due to his mask but enjoys treating others as he can enjoy the food through their reaction of it.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch56Pg11-4)

## Plot

### History

The Violence Fiend's human host died in unknown circumstances. All he remembers is that [Makima](/makima "Makima") saved him.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch56Pg13-5) Considering Makima’s abilities, his background might be fabricated by her.

### [Katana Man arc](/katana-man-arc "Katana Man arc")

As a member of Special Division 4 the Violence Fiend is one of the many non-humans participating in the raid on the terrorists led by [Akane Sawatari](/akane-sawatari "Akane Sawatari"). He takes part is slaughtering several zombies inside the building and is almost accidentally bitten by Beam. He punches the Shark Fiend aside, claiming to mistake him for a zombie due to his biting attack. He also mistakes the Spider Devil for a human lady and warns her to leave the area before realizing his mistake.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg5_-_7-2)

### [Bomb Girl arc](/bomb-girl-arc "Bomb Girl arc")

The Violence Fiend and [Kobeni Higashiyama](/kobeni-higashiyama "Kobeni Higashiyama") responds to [Aki Hayakawa](/aki-hayakawa "Aki Hayakawa")'s request for reinforcements against the attacking [Reze](/reze "Reze"). He kicks her off the roof of Aki's car and launches a full-power kick at her that cracks the ground she stands on but does no damage to her. Recognizing that they are outmatched he shouts a warning at Kobeni to retreat and promptly leaves through a nearby doorway.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch47Pg4_-_8-6)

Later, as Aki battles Reze one-on-one, the Violence Fiend intervenes to save Aki's life from a missile explosion. When they prepare to fight Reze together, she calls for a timeout due to being nearly out of blood and the Violence Fiend suggests giving her a handicap. When Aki refuses the Violence Fiend apologizes to Reze. Before they can engage her the [Typhoon Devil](/typhoon-devil "Typhoon Devil") enters the scene.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch49Pg4_-_8-7)

Unable to help in the massive brawl between [Denji](/denji "Denji") and Beam against Reze and the Typhoon Devil, the Violence Fiend watches the fight from the sidelines.[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch50Pg1-8)

### [International Assassins arc](/international-assassins-arc "International Assassins arc")

Kobeni and the Violence Fiend went out on a patrol and encountered an unknown devil which the Violence Fiend killed. When Kobeni questioning what type of devil it should be reported as, the Violence Fiend ventured a guess that it was a [Grapes Devil](/grape-devil "Grape Devil"). They took a break afterwards and the Violence Fiend bought Kobeni an ice-cream as a treat.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Ch56Pg10_-_11-9)

Kobeni tells the Violence Fiend of a story from her childhood when she first tried ice-cream before commenting that for a Violence Fiend he isn't a very violent person. He agrees with her and explains that it is due to still retaining a lot of his human brain. He explains that he can't remember much except that Makima saved him. Suddenly a man appearing to be [Kurose](/kurose "Kurose") appears in a bullet-riddled car claiming that his partner and master were both gunned down. He orders them to report the incident to HQ and they run off to obey to him.[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch56Pg12_-_16-10)

During the fight against the dolls, [Kishibe](/kishibe "Kishibe") told Galgali and Kobeni to go after them. Once everyone is dragged into hell, Galgali asks Kobeni to take off his mask so he can be at his fullest power as a fiend. He aims to fight the [Darkness Devil](/darkness-devil "Darkness Devil") but is killed in battle.

## Abilities

As a [fiend](/fiend "Fiend"), Galgali can't make [contracts](/contract "Contract"). However, he still has all the other standard [devil abilities](/devil#general-abilities "Devil").

### Physical Abilities

-   **Enhanced Strength**: The Violence Fiend has extraordinary power for a fiend despite fiends ordinarily being weaker than devils. In order to keep his strength in check he is forced to wear a poison-dispensing mask.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg6-1) When fighting against Reze, the Violence Fiend's kicks were strong enough to crack the ground she stood on after she blocked his attack.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch47Pg4_-_8-6)
-   **Poison Resistance**: While he is put into a weakened state from his poison dispensing mask, he shows no signs of any ill effects from it.

### Devil Powers

-   **Body Transformation**: Violence has been shown during his attack on Reze, that he can access his strength and transform portions of his body to that of his released state. Doing so, said limb will enlarge and gain muscle mass, becoming immensely more powerful.

### Skillset

-   **Hand-to-Hand Combat**: The Violence Fiend's primary fighting style is unarmed combat; being able to knock back Beam with a punch and decapitate a zombie at point-blank range with a kick.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg5_-_7-2)

## Trivia

-   Galgali's rankings in the [Popularity Polls](/popularity-polls "Popularity Polls") are as follows:
    -   Galgali ranked 15th in the First Popularity Poll with 3,025 votes.
    -   Galgali ranked 17th in the Second Popularity Poll with 5,226 votes.
-   Galgali's name comes from **Galgalim** (ガルガリム, _Garugarimu_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")), another name for the Ophanim, which are the eye-covered flaming wheels that form the Chariot of God in the Old Testament. They are commonly equated with the **Thrones**, a type of angel from the highest order of Christian angel hierarchy along with the Seraphim and the Cherubim.
    -   Galgali was one of the followers of Chainsaw Man along with **Seraphim**, [Beam](/beam "Beam"), [Angel Devil](/angel-devil "Angel Devil"), [Princi](/princi "Princi"), **Dominion**, **Virtue**, and [Power](/power "Power").
    -   He has several eyes with his mask off, which is similar to how the angels of his namesake have multiple eyes.
-   Galgali’s situation is different from that of [Asa](/asa-mitaka "Asa Mitaka") and [Yoru](/yoru "Yoru")’s as he is not a fiend with a sentient host or a human resurrected by the Devil, but he is the Violence Devil itself who managed to absorb his dead host’s many memories because of the rare circumstance of the corpse’s brain being fresh enough. It is also ambiguous if there was some form of intentional memory alteration involved given his comment on Makima “saving” him but this remains mysterious.

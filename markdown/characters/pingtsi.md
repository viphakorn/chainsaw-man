## Appearance

Pingtsi possesses a corpse with dark hair with a blue hue and has an futakuchi-onna-like ponytail along with eye-length bangs and slightly longer side bangs. Given the same coloration of the ponytail and the rest of the hair it is unknown if the ponytail was originally a part of the corpse or a part of the devil that took the form of one. All of the hair bands she wears have been shown as red. She wears a long sleeved, knee-length black dress with white cuffs and a dress collar. She wears plain black shoes and black leggings. Her eyes on her ponytail seem to be purple while the eyes on her face may either be red or also purple. She is considerably shorter than the rest of Quanxi’s fiends.

## Personality

Pingtsi is a very cheerful, talkative girl who likes to share useless facts in order to impress or entertain Quanxi.

## Plot

### [International Assassins arc](/international-assassins-arc "International Assassins arc")

## Abilities

As a [fiend](/fiend "Fiend"), Pingtsi can't make [contracts](/contract "Contract") and her powers are considerably weaker than those of her devil form. However, she still has all the other standard [devil abilities](/devil#general-abilities "Devil").

### Devil Powers

-   **Magnifying Glass**: Her ponytail can turn into a magnifying glass or monocle and seems to detect information. Such as when she could find out what devils a person is contracted with, described in more detail below. When she and the others got sent to Hell, even when all the fiends were uncomfortable from the area including herself, she managed to give out information in detail about the Primal Fears watching everyone and was shown having her magnifying glass out.
    -   **Contract Perception**: Her ability allows her to gain information on what Devil [contracts](/contract "Contract") a human has. She used this ability against [Kishibe](/kishibe "Kishibe") and revealed his contracted devils and the lack of sacrifices in his body, which suggests that she is able to foresee possible sacrifices required to use abilities of contracted devils.

### Skill Set

-   **Bilingual**: Pingtsi has demonstrated the ability to speak both Japanese and Chinese, but couldn’t understand Japanese at first and needed to use her magnifying glass to collect information.

## Appearance

### Near-death State

Following the battle with the [Four Horsemen](/four-horsemen "Four Horsemen") and [Weapon Devils](/weapon-devils "Weapon Devils"), Yoru was also reduced to a “near-death state”, due to Pochita consuming most of her body. In this state, she appears to have a bird-like body, similar to a dark colored owl or potoo. While her bird form is similar to [Pochita](/pochita "Pochita")'s dog form, her true form is still unknown.

### Fiend

After taking over Asa's body and occupying half of her brain, the War Devil took on her appearance, but with added facial scars across her the center of her face and left cheek, which are in the same location where Mitaka's face was slashed by the [Class President](/class-president "Class President"). In this form, Yoru's eyes have multiple rings, similar to [Makima](/makima "Makima"), who was another Horseman. Her hair is also usually worn loose rather than in twin tails like Mitaka. Yoru always wears the same clothes as Asa, most commonly a school uniform.

## Personality

Yoru is first shown to be very confident and prideful, treating her opponents as mere warm-ups and confidently vowing to take back [nuclear weapons](/nuclear-weapons-devil "Nuclear Weapons Devil") from [Chainsaw Man](/pochita "Pochita"). This might be a sign of her over-confidence as she lost to him previously while at full strength and is significantly weaker now. However she is aware of her limitations and will back down from a fight if she believes the odds are against her.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch112Pg8-1)[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch122Pg16-2) Yoru holds little sentimental value or attachments to humans, and is mostly uncaring of Mitaka's feelings, as evidenced by her blatant disregard for Mitaka's feeling of friendship for Yuko, repeatedly asking Mitaka to kill Yuko to use as a weapon or when she goes as far as to physically hurt Asa herself to forcefully regain control albeit with the intention of saving them both. She's been shown to be very cold and logical which clashes with Asa's highly emotional personality. Since she's completely unaffected by the [Falling Devil](/falling-devil "Falling Devil"), that means she easily gets over highly traumatic events such as being almost killed by Pochita and losing her power. Due to her predisposed nature as the War Devil, she keeps getting into conflicts with everyone around her, sometimes intentionally sometimes not. Ironically these conflicts usually serve to hurt her.

Unlike her fellow Horseman [Makima](/makima "Makima"), who was almost always calm and composed, Yoru is more flawed, immature and naïve. She is prone to losing her temper, and became embarrassed and angry at being rescued unintentionally by her archenemy, Chainsaw Man. In her anger, she sometimes throws childish tantrums by punching and screaming into the pillows on Asa's bed.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch104Pg1-3) She is very insecure and gets royally offended whenever her strength or intellect is questioned.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch112Pg9-4)[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch105Pg2-5) Yoru is also worried about losing her power and being forgotten, showing a more sensitive side. Adding to that, she seems to show signs of sympathy, at least towards Asa.

She does not have a good understanding of human society or relationships and takes things at face value, is easy to provoke and often threatens [Mitaka](/asa-mitaka "Asa Mitaka") with death. Though over time she grows closer to her and seems to understand and adapt to human society more, albeit she's still quite inept and will often unintentionally worsen her relationship with Asa because of that. Despite her apparent social-ineptitude she is very cunning in dangerous situations such as when fighting Devils and is easily able to keep a cool head unlike Asa. Though in the most extreme of circumstances Yoru will panic and scream out in fright, such as when Asa was caught by the Falling Devil.

## Relationships

### [Asa Mitaka](/asa-mitaka "Asa Mitaka")

Yoru resurrected and inhabits Asa's body, turning her into the War Fiend, but left half of Asa's brain intact, keeping Asa alive. With the two now sharing one body, Yoru was originally planning to use Mitaka as a way to blend into human society as she's unfamiliar with it. At first she is very hostile, threatening to kill Mitaka if she doesn't cooperate. However, she did not go through with her threat of killing Mitaka when Mitaka refused to go into school,[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch99Pg11-6) and despite making such threats several more times through the story all of them seemed to be no more than saber rattling without any real weight behind them. Yoru is tolerant of Asa's antics, frequently compromising with her and has offered to do favors for Mitaka, such as "take care of" the kids who were bullying her and provided the easier name of "Yoru" when Mitaka complained that "War Devil" was too difficult to use as a name. Her vendetta against Chainsaw Man means that she will tolerate anything so long as her goal is ultimately still being worked towards.

After their fight with [Yuko](/yuko "Yuko"), Yoru's perception of Asa changes, no longer viewing her simply as a means to blend-in but realizing that Asa is extremely good at making strong weapons.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch123Pg4-7)[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch108Pg11-8) Because of this, Yoru views Asa as indispensable as she cannot defeat Chainsaw Man without her help. Hinting at this is the fact that she told Asa to "stay back" after encountering the [Falling Devil](/falling-devil "Falling Devil") suggesting she might have took over not only with the intent to protect herself but also Asa specifically. Another example is when Yoru didn't take over the rest of Asa's brain (which would kill her) even while Mitaka is actively putting both of them in grave danger. Yoru has created her mental image of Asa's personality; despite being baffled that someone would feel guilt over destroying an aquarium, she comments that that is typical for Asa. Her mental image of Asa is fairly flawed as Yoru deeply miscalculates Asa's behaviour in a life-or-death situation, being very confused when Asa gets scared and mad at Yoru for cutting her hand.

Over time Asa grew used to Yoru's presence to the point of trying to chat with her having forgotten that they're currently separated.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Ch114Pg16-9) However despite growing used to Yoru's presence she's still not fully comfortable with her and doesn't trust her one bit. Yoru on the other hand, being a Devil, still doesn't understand Asa and gets frustrated at her perceived irrational behaviour, it's likely she doesn't understand the concept of depression and assumes Asa's sadness came entirely from the influence of the Falling Devil.

In tense moments Yoru, particularly if Asa's fear is preventing her from taking control, will go to cruel measures to save themselves such as self-harm. Yoru doesn't even consider there might be a better way of handling Asa's stress such as just calming her down since she's not used to pain and fighting. Though her cruel measures don't seem to be done out of malice but purely out of a logical and survivalist mentality. Asa does not appreciate this at all however. Yoru was confused and angry at Asa's emotional response to this as she thought she was only trying to help her. Either due to her lack of humanity or a misunderstanding of Asa's character she continues trying to convince Asa using cold and logical arguments despite the latter being emotionally distressed. Ignoring Yoru's unsupportive comments she grows frustrated that Yoru still doesn't understand her feelings despite being able to read her mind and continues to break down in front of her perhaps seeing comfort which Yoru unfortunately still does not provide.

Yoru will occasionally mention when she thinks Asa is being too self-deprecating and will half heartedly try to comfort her which could be signs of genuine sympathy.[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch121Pg14-10) However, Yoru could simply be putting on a mask to make Asa more likely to continue cooperating with her. Yoru still values her own goals greatly over Asa's feelings as shown by her deciding to kill Yuko despite Asa's protest or trying to turn [Denji](/denji "Denji") into a weapon after Asa falls in love with him. She has also been shown to be manipulative towards Asa, such as trying to gaslight her into killing Yuko[\[11\]](#cite_note-Ch102Pg6-11) or morally justifying murder as a "necessary evil".[\[12\]](#cite_note-Ch112Pg22-12)

### [Denji](/denji "Denji")

Yoru and Asa decided Denji would be their target to be turned into a weapon. Despite not getting involved directly Yoru will push Asa to continue her date with him even if things don't go her way.[\[13\]](#cite_note-Ch113Pg12-13) She views him as a punk and is annoyed at her feelings of affection for him due to sharing Asa's brain. However her feelings for him are very shallow as she immediately tries using these feelings to turn him into a weapon, albeit unsuccessfully.

Later during his movie date with Asa, she tries to push him away presumably to keep him safe from Yoru. In response she takes over and kisses Denji likely in hopes of quickly winning his heart which would allow her to finally turn him into a weapon, but she is swiftly incapacitated by [Nayuta](/nayuta "Nayuta") instead. After kissing him, she could be seen visibly blushing. After their memories have been wiped and altered she assumes Denji stood them up but is indifferent to it and swiftly suggests they target a different boy instead. This is in stark contrast with Asa's reaction who was deeply hurt.

Though she doesn't know it yet, Denji is her fabled arch-nemesis Chainsaw Man, who she eventually hopes to defeat in order to regain Nuclear Weapons and get revenge. She despises [him](/pochita "Pochita") for defeating and weakening her which caused wars to cease and in turn reduced her to a shadow of her former self. Furthermore because of him she is currently on track to be forgotten about and stop existing which she's afraid of. She hates him to the point where she had a meltdown after she's unintentionally saved by him from the [Bat Devil](/bat-devil "Bat Devil"). To her dismay the situation repeats itself as they are saved by him once more during the [Falling Devil](/falling-devil "Falling Devil") fight.

### [Fami](/fami "Fami")

Fami, who views Yoru as her "little sister", claims to be willing to do anything to help her often without Yoru's own consent such as when she trapped Asa and Denji in the aquarium. Despite her apparent affection for her, Yoru doesn't reciprocate those feelings, as she describes her as insane and wants to stay away from her. Fami's contradictory behavior described below could be the reason why Yoru called her insane.

Despite her apparent care for Yoru, she contradictorily doesn't seem to care about her safety and often puts her in harms way, such as when she got her under attack by the [Eternity Devil](/eternity-devil "Eternity Devil") or later when she sent the [Falling Devil](/falling-devil "Falling Devil") after her. As it turns out Famis main goal is to starve Yoru so that she may brainwash her and use her to stop the [Nostradamus Prophecy](/the-prophecy "The Prophecy").

## Abilities

As a Fiend, Yoru can not make [contracts](/contract "Contract"). However, she still has all the other standard [Devil abilities](/devil#general-abilities "Devil"), such as reviving in Hell after being killed, restoring her health by consuming blood, fear empowerment and enhanced physical prowess.

### Unique

Currently, Yoru has taken possession of Asa Mitaka's body, after her head got sliced in half by the [Class President](/class-president "Class President"). The War Devil, however, only took over half of her brain, leaving Mitaka’s consciousness intact while still being able to take control over Mitaka’s body anytime she wants to unless Asa is stricken with fear. [\[14\]](#cite_note-Ch101Pg17-14)[\[15\]](#cite_note-Ch99Pg13-14-15) Adding to that if Yoru is already in control but Asa get's frightened she'll lose control and be unable to regain it until Asa calms down.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Ch123Pg18-16)

-   Thanks to this unusual circumstance Yoru is able to feel human emotions despite being a Devil.[\[17\]](#cite_note-Ch117Pg15-17)[\[18\]](#cite_note-Ch63Pg4-18) Whoever isn’t in control of the body will appear as a hallucination to the other and can even communicate to them.[\[19\]](#cite_note-Ch99Pg5-19) In addition Yoru is able to read Mitaka’s thoughts and access her memories while the latter is unable to do the same.[\[20\]](#cite_note-Ch99Pg21-20)[\[21\]](#cite_note-Ch124Pg10-21)

### Supernatural Abilities

Although part of the [Four Horsemen](/four-horsemen "Four Horsemen"), Yoru claims that her Devil power weakened after her body was partially devoured by Chainsaw Man. This, combined with the long absence of wars in the human world (the concept of which is only been relegated to movies and videogames), has greatly diminished her original strength.[\[22\]](#cite_note-Ch104Pg3-22) Adding to that her strength was reduced even further by becoming a [Fiend](/fiend "Fiend").

-   Combining all of these factors her current strength is a mere fraction of her full power and is by far the weakest horsemen.

#### Physical Prowess

-   **Enhanced Speed**: Yoru is able to move very quickly, easily jumping around and dodging attacks from the contracted Class President and Yuko's Devil form.
-   **Enhanced Strength**: Yoru was able to pull Tanaka's head off his shoulders and spinal cord out of his body, requiring a great deal of force, and is able to easily carry objects as big as herself with one arm over her head.
-   **Enhanced Durability**: Yoru is able to take hits that would kill an ordinary person, such as during her battle with Yuko she took a serious hit that flung her across a classroom and into a wall, but was able to get up moments later without any injuries.

#### Weapon Creation

Yoru has the power to make anything that belongs to her into a weapon. This includes both objects and living beings. In order to activate the weapon transformation, Yoru must touch what belongs to her and call out its weapon name. The strength of the weapon is proportional to the amount of guilt Yoru and/or Asa feel about creating said weapon. There is no objective measure of when something belongs to Asa or Yoru, it relies entirely on their own perception and logic as shown when Asa paid 1 million yen to "buy" an entire aquarium and despite it being nowhere near enough money, it still qualified to be turned into a weapon.

So far the only types of weapons that were created have been either melee weapons, such as swords and spears, or explosives such as hand grenades. It is unknown whether Yoru can create more advanced weapons such as modern firearms.

-   **Flesh Weapon Creation**: Yoru is able to make anyone she "owns", including humans, Devils and Fiends, into a variety of deadly weapons almost instantaneously simply by touching them. This does not appear to immediately kill the human, as they can still scream in agony. In order to make a flesh weapon, Yoru must either: take a limb from the victim which she can then turn into a weapon, kill them and turn their remains into weapons, or form a relationship with someone wherein they "belong to her". She can also make weapons from her own body parts which will violently tear themselves off her if she does so. Flesh weapons created by the War Devil so far are:
    -   **Tanaka Spinal Cord Sword** (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>田</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>た</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>中</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>なか</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>脊</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>せき</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>髄</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ずい</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>剣</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>けん</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _Tanaka Sekizuiken_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")): A long crooked sword that the War Devil created using [Tanaka](/tanaka "Tanaka")'s head and spinal cord that is ripped out of his body.[\[23\]](#cite_note-Ch98Pg41-42-23) The blade is sharp enough to easily cut through Devil-enhanced flesh with ease.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Ch98Pg46-24)
    -   **Flesh Hand Grenade** (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>手</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>しゅ</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>榴</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>りゅう</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>弾</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>だん</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _Shuryūdan_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")): A hand grenade that the War Devil created using the arm from the contracted Class President.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Ch98Pg45-25) And it is shown that it is able to detonate like a normal grenade.[\[26\]](#cite_note-Ch98Pg47-26)
    -   **Yuko Leg Sword** (ユウコ<ruby lang="ja"><rb>足</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>あし</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>剣</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>けん</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _Yūko Ashiken_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")): A katana-like blade made from one of Yuko's legs that were severed by the [Devil Hunter Club](/devil-hunter-club "Devil Hunter Club"), it presumably lacked unique abilities due to Yoru's lack of guilt, but it never managed to be used.[\[27\]](#cite_note-Ch110Pg1-27)
-   **Object Weapon Creation:** Yoru has shown the ability to turn objects that belong to her into weapons. Objects that belong to her can either be things she bought or things she took. Weapons created by the War Devil so far are:
    -   **Pencil Spear** (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>鉛</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>えん</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>筆</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ぴつ</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> の<ruby lang="ja"><rb>槍</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>やり</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _Enpitsu no Yari_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")): A wooden spear made from a school pencil. This weapon changes form with each pencil, some are three-pronged spears approximately two meters long, others a meter long spear with four smaller spikes along the side. This weapon is sharp enough to easily kill a human, although Yoru calls them weak weapons.
    -   **Ruler Sword** (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>定</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>じょう</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>規</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ぎ</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>剣</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>けん</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _Jōgi Ken_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")): A sword made by a measuring ruler found in Asa's backpack. It is a rectangular shaped sword approximately one meter long with a hole at its base for a handle.

### Skillset

-   **Swordsmanship**: Yoru is a skilled swordswoman, being able to easily take down the contracted Class President with her sword.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Ch98Pg46-24)
-   **Spearmanship**: Yoru also demonstrates her skills on using a spear during her fight against the reincarnated [Eternity Devil](/eternity-devil "Eternity Devil").
-   **Strategic Intelligence**: Yoru prepared quite an elaborate setup in preparation for fighting Yuko, such as setting up traps and hiding weapons all around the school. This however wasn't of much use due to contracted Yuko's mind reading ability.[\[28\]](#cite_note-Ch107Pg17-28)

## Etymology

-   Yoru could be translated as "night" (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>夜</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>よる</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _Yoru_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")) as a counterpart to Asa, which could be translated as "morning" (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>朝</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>あさ</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _Asa_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")).
-   Yoru's scar is similar to the simplified version of the kanji radical (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>戈</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ほこ</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _hoko_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")), which means "halberd" or "arms". The same radical is used in the kanji (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>戦</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>せん</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _sen_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")), which means "war".

## Trivia

-   The War Devil's bird-like appearance is that of a bird of prey, which often symbolize war or warriors. In politics, a war hawk or hawk is someone who favors war.
-   Yoru's predilection for making swords or edged weapons may be a reference to the depiction of the Horseman of War in the Book of Revelation, where he is depicted holding a sword.
-   It is unknown if Yoru's distinctive head trait as a fiend can be seen by others when she is in control, or if only Asa sees it.
-   Yoru and Asa's exact species or "type" hasn’t been confirmed or explicitly stated in the manga as of currently, which has lead to much debate about their species, but for simplicity of the wiki and until else is confirmed, Yoru will be referred to as a fiend with Asa as her living host.
-   The text on the back cover of [Volume 12](/volume-12 "Volume 12") foresees that Yoru will unleash a great calamity upon the entire world.

This unnamed man was **the father of [Denji](/denji "Denji")**. When Denji was young he killed his father in self defense, as his father was in a drunken aggressive state and he feared for his life. His fathers murder was ruled a suicide by the adults in Denji’s life as acknowledging his death as a murder would mean they would be unable to get any money from his death. After his death, Denji inherits his debt to the [Yakuza](/yakuza "Yakuza").

## Appearance

Of the little that is seen of him, Denji's father seemed to have the same hair just as his son.

## Personality

Little is known of his personality, as he was deceased prior to the chronological beginning of the plot. [Makima](/makima "Makima") describes him as an abusive alcoholic, who was violent enough with Denji to the point where he was killed by his own son in self-defense. It is also implied that he had an addictive personality, losing large amounts of money to the Yakuza resulting in a massive debt which Denji later inherited.

## Plot

### History

### [Intro arc](/intro-arc "Intro arc")

### [Control Devil arc](/control-devil-arc "Control Devil arc")

[Makima](/makima "Makima"), when revealing her intentions to [Denji](/denji "Denji"), reveals that she investigated his past and knows that his father died not from suicide, but rather from being killed at Denji's hands in an act of self-defense. His supposed suicide was, in reality, a ruse created by the Yakuza in order to have Denji inherit his debts.

Denji had been repressing this fact behind a psychological barrier, which is represented by a closed door, and when the memory comes to light Denji sees himself as a child, standing over his father's wounded and bleeding corpse.

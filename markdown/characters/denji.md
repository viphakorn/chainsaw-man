## Appearance

### Human Form (Pre-Fusion)

Denji is a teenage boy with blond and scruffy hair. He has yellow-brown eyes and bags underneath, resulting in a dazed and tired expression. His teeth are noticeably sharp and angular. Due to malnutrition in his childhood, he has a scrawny build with protruding ribs, and due to the stress of what he did for a living, he’s often mistaken for being older than he actually is. Before becoming a [Hybrid](/wiki/Hybrid "Hybrid"), Denji was missing his right eye and several other non-essential organs, including a testicle and a kidney.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch1Pg1_-_3-1) He covered his missing eye with an eyepatch. He also wears a loose white tank top, a green jacket and black pants during this time.

### Human Form (Post-Fusion)

After Denji forms a contract with Pochita, his heart is fused with Pochita, a chainsaw cord forms in the middle of his sternum and he regains his lost organs along with having a muscular build.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch1Pg37-2)

He spent much of his time wearing the standard Public Safety Devil Hunter uniform, consisting of a white shirt, tie, and slacks. He wore the uniform carelessly, his shirt wrinkled and sleeves rolled up.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch3Pg4-3)

After resigning from a Public Safety Devil Hunter, Denji now wears [Fourth East High School](/wiki/Fourth_East_High_School "Fourth East High School")'s uniform, a black buttoned long-sleeved shirt (which he mainly wears unbuttoned) and black pants.

### Hybrid Form

If his chainsaw cord is pulled while he has enough blood for the transformation, then his head will morph into a demonic, mechanical shape with long, jagged fangs and a chainsaw handle on the back. Large chainsaws will emerge from his forehead, arms and legs, he is able to retract and extract any of them at will.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch1Pg42-4) If Denji's chainsaw cord is pulled while he does not have enough blood, then a chainsaw blade will partially emerge from his face.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch9Pg16-5)

### Devil Form

After losing his will to live and surrendering himself to Makima, Pochita takes control of Denji's body and reveals the true Chainsaw Devil, completely losing his human consciousness and letting Pochita take over. Prior to the transformation, his intestines emerge from his stomach and wrap around his neck, resembling a scarf or a collar. Once transformed, his body is black, looking to be covered with either armored plates or scales. He gains spikes on his shoulders and the back of his head, and the handle on the back of his head disappears. He becomes much larger and bulkier, towering over the average human. His arms split at the elbows, each with two forearms equipped with their own Chainsaw Blades.

Pseudo Hybrid form (manga)

## Personality

Denji is both brash and naïve as a result of being unable to have a formal education and socialize due to living in severe poverty. His personality comes off as rude and harsh in an almost childish way. However, he has a good sense of empathy towards other people, willing to save those in danger as much as he could, showing he is a kind-hearted person despite his shortcomings. While Denji doesn't necessarily possess the highest intelligence, he is capable of clever ideas to take down Devils, such as lighting himself on fire and using the light emitted to weaken [Santa Claus](/wiki/Santa_Claus "Santa Claus") enough to kill her.

After becoming a Public Safety Devil Hunter and fulfilling his basic needs, Denji is unsure of what he wants in life. Many of Denji's said basic needs were fueled by sexual desire, going so far as to accept dangerous missions in exchange for some form of sexual gratification. One such case was feeling up [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") in exchange for rescuing her cat, however, he later realized and laments that the satisfaction from such intimate acts is fleeting. Denji also harbors a fear that his seeming lack of empathy and attachment after his transformation is a sign that he is losing his sense of humanity.

While transformed into his Hybrid form, Denji becomes extremely ruthless, aggressive, bloodthirsty and sadistic, releasing his most deranged side while facing other Devils, to the point of enjoying killing them. He also displays a twisted and sarcastic sense of humor. The first time he transformed into his Hybrid form he found it amusing that he could pay off his debt by killing all the Yakuza members who were turned into zombies due to the power of the [Zombie Devil](/wiki/Zombie_Devil "Zombie Devil"). While facing the [Eternity Devil](/wiki/Eternity_Devil "Eternity Devil") he says that "its blood tastes like rat but drinking it while watching a son of a bitch suffering and feeling terrified makes it taste as delicious as a strawberry jam", and considers himself a genius for creating a "perpetual motion machine" worthy enough of a Nobel Prize.

As the story progresses, it becomes more evident that Denji is emotionally damaged, and desperate to feel love and be loved by someone. He clings to Makima as a coping mechanism, even going as far as stating that his wish was to just be a mindless dog, so he would not feel hurt from losing the things and people he loved. This backfired, as watching Power die was enough for him to surrender himself to Makima completely, essentially erasing his personality and mental state. This is still evident when Denji tells Kishibe that he did not set out to kill Makima, but rather become one with her, allowing him to defeat her.

Near the end of the first part, as well as at the start of the second part, Denji starts growing more ambitious and lavish in his desires; whilst before he was happy with simply being able to eat jam on toast and feeling a girl's chest, now he desires to have steak for breakfast every day and to have numerous, lustful girlfriends. It's also shown he has grown more arrogant in his Devil-slaying, as he is willing to expose his identity if it means he'd get more attention from girls, despite how disastrous the consequences would be.

As such, at the beginning of the second part, Denji's personality seems to have remained relatively stagnant, aimed at openly leaving clues that indicate that he is Chainsaw Man, such as leaving his school I.D. at the scene of his fight with the [Cockroach Devil](/wiki/Cockroach_Devil "Cockroach Devil"), or directly telling [Asa Mitaka](/wiki/Asa_Mitaka "Asa Mitaka") that he is Chainsaw Man (to which she thinks he is bluffing). He also reveals himself to be obsessed with money, so much so that he is willing to let others pay to use him as a "chair" for a few yen (although he seems to enjoy it when a woman uses him as a chair) and to sell used cigarettes to the homeless, passing them off as new, just to make money.

However, Denji later demonstrates the true motivation behind most of these behaviors, which is to fund his [adopted sister](/wiki/Nayuta "Nayuta")'s education, thus showing that he has matured following the disastrous consequences of letting Makima groom, abuse, and control him in their relationship, becoming more independent and standing up for himself without allowing others to dictate his behavior. During the date with Asa, Denji becomes flustered and angry with her when she told him that he didn't need to think about anything, possibly reminding him of his relationship with Makima. He further reveals to Asa that the reason he is desperately saving money is to provide Nayuta with a proper education and a comfortable lifestyle, showing that he has acquired a strong sense of responsibility towards others.

The trauma from Part 1 has clearly taken a toll on him. He displays practically none of the enthusiasm and upbeat demeanor he did before, and is constantly seen with a haggard expression and baggy eyes. He openly admits to Asa that he still hasn't gotten over his horrendous past. In spite of this, Denji still believes that life consists of more than just pain and that his reason to live makes him willing to endure the bad aspects of life. When asked what that reason is, he replies with sex, his main source of motivation.

Due to his desire to have intercourse with a woman, he generally treats women with more kindness and respect than men. He does his best to treat women with respect and never does anything without their explicit consent. When he and Asa were escaping from the large clawed tendrils, he refused Asa's instructions to steal a woman's motorcycle, calling her a thief. However, when she asks him to steal a man's motorcycle, he doesn't hesitate to kick the man off his motorcycle, telling him to beat it. He also in Part 1 told Aki that when he fights against men he usually aims to their intimate zone (their testicules) and demonstrated it when they had a fight and Denji kicked him several times in that zone.

## Relationships

### Devils

#### [Pochita](/wiki/Pochita "Pochita")

Pochita was saved by Denji when in his time of need by feeding him his blood to recover from an injury, leading to them befriending one another Devil and Human alike. This allowed the debt that filled young Denji to be dealt with by becoming a young demon hunter with the help of Pochita. Later after being a Demon Hunter his whole life Denji was betrayed by the debt collector and brutally murdered by zombified humans. This death caused Pochita to become Denji's heart due to a contract making Denji a Devil-human Hybrid.

### Love Interests

#### [Makima](/wiki/Makima "Makima")

Makima and Denji shared an asymmetrical relationship: whereas Denji was greatly infatuated with Makima and willing to go to great lengths to serve her, Makima saw Denji as nothing more than a pet and tool, taking interest in him solely for the fact that the Chainsaw Devil Pochita resided in his heart. To this end, Makima masterminded a plot to control the Chainsaw Devil by manipulating Denji, setting up circumstances that would allow Denji to experience the love, companionship, and comfort that he had craved his entire life, before violently stripping him of everything he cared about in an attempt to break him and bring out Chainsaw Man. Despite discovering her plot, her identity as the Control Devil, and the fact that he meant nothing to her, Denji would still continue to love Makima. To him, although she had betrayed him and had brutally slaughtered his closest friends, she had been one of the few people in his life to show him affection.

Denji's love for Makima and her apathy towards him would prove key to her defeat. Makima was ambushed by Denji with a chainsaw, as he realized that she only remembered people she was interested in by their scents, and thus would not be able to recognize Denji because she had never memorized his scent. Following this ambush, Denji successfully killed her by committing cannibalism and eating her body. By doing so, he was not attacking Makima but was instead "becoming one with her", which bypassed the conditions of her contract with the Prime Minister of Japan that made her impervious to fatal injuries.

After Makima's death, Denji would end up becoming the caretaker of her dogs and her reincarnation Nayuta. Having been told by Pochita that the Control Devil's greatest dream was to form equal relationships with others, Denji dedicated himself to granting the Control Devil's dream by lovingly raising Nayuta and becoming her family, lest she becomes another version of Makima.

#### [Reze](/wiki/Reze "Reze")

Much like with Makima, Denji had an asymmetrical relationship with Reze. While Denji becomes quickly infatuated with her, Reze was only manipulating him and saw him as nothing more than a tool. In order to kill him and steal his [heart](/wiki/Pochita "Pochita"), Reze orchestrated a plan to make Denji fall for her, pretending to have a crush on him, teaching Denji how to swim and giving him the experience of going to school. Even after knowing that she deceived and attempted to kill him, Denji still dreamed of escaping and starting a new life with Reze, thus he refused to kill her. He was later seen waiting for her in the cafe she used to work as a cover, though after waiting for an entire day, he came to the disappointing realization that she wasn't returning.

#### [Asa Mitaka](/wiki/Asa_Mitaka "Asa Mitaka") / [Yoru](/wiki/Yoru "Yoru")

Asa and Denji share a strong bond, though neither fully know it yet. [Yoru](/wiki/Yoru "Yoru"), the War Devil who has taken Asa's body, is extremely desperate to kill the Chainsaw Man in order to spark actual war once again. Asa, while once holding strong negative feelings towards the Chainsaw Man due to her belief that he was a fraud and lumping him with the Devil that killed her family, has gained a more neutral stance on him. After [Hirofumi Yoshida](/wiki/Hirofumi_Yoshida "Hirofumi Yoshida") introduced Asa to Denji, they immediately have conflicting attitudes and when Denji reveals himself to be the Chainsaw Man, she disbelieves him and calls him a loser. Later, coerced by Yoru needing a weapon so that she could stop bothering Asa, she asks Denji on a date, which he reluctantly accepts.

Though their date starts off on the wrong foot, Denji and Asa start to bond after being trapped in the aquarium by the [Eternity Devil](/wiki/Eternity_Devil "Eternity Devil") and [Fami](/wiki/Fami "Fami"). Denji tries to cheer her up by smiling and finding her something to eat, then asks if she's ever had starfish before, which also implies that he was paying attention to her during her previous exposition on sea life. Denji says that he loves Asa's mannerisms, as he finds her fun to watch and also reminds him of "an old friend", who is most likely Power. Both Asa and he also take noticeable enjoyment in each other's presence when the two of them run around the aquarium, searching for money. He also agrees to obey Asa for an instance in exchange for any request he would like to make of her. Despite the rough first date, Denji admits that he has come to like Asa and asks her on a second date, to which she agrees. Before Denji says goodbye to Asa, Yoru possesses her and attempts to turn Denji into a weapon. It does not work, and Yoru and Asa take it that Denji does not reciprocate their feelings. On their second date, Asa hides her actual feelings, lying to Denji by stating that she hates him when she just wants to protect him from being turned into a weapon. However, Denji does confirm that he has some feelings for Asa. Later, Nayuta brainwashes Asa into thinking she is a dog and threatens to keep her that way unless Denji stops seeing her, which he reluctantly accepts.

Despite Nayuta's warning, Denji (as Chainsaw Man) saves Asa from the [Falling Devil](/wiki/Falling_Devil "Falling Devil")'s attack, telling the latter to stay away from his "potential ex-girlfriend." He tries to help her cope with her negative emotions and trauma but unintentionally grosses her out with his love for sex. Asa tells him that no woman would want to be with a guy with a chainsaw sticking out of his head, causing Denji to despair and fall into Hell. There, he carries Asa and keeps protecting her. When the Falling Devil tells him to leave her, he asks if he can take her rear back with him, causing the Falling Devil to look down on him.

### Friends

#### [Aki Hayakawa](/wiki/Aki_Hayakawa "Aki Hayakawa")

Aki and Denji initially began as distrustful teammates, as Aki strongly disliked Denji: he despised Denji for his Devil nature and his bold, crass personality. Aki would openly state to Denji that he had no qualms about killing him if he became useless. In turn, Denji reciprocated Aki's hostility. Though hostile, they would still begrudgingly cooperate with each other, as both were commanded to do so by Makima, and Aki recognized Denji's utility as a tool.

Over time, however, their relationship would change: after being forced to live with each other by Makima and working with each other on missions, Aki and Denji slowly became close, and would eventually become best friends. In the face of tragedies and sadness, Denji and Aki comforted one another, such as when Denji gave Aki an apple after Himeno's death, or when Aki comforted Denji over their canceled trip with Makima.

After becoming the [Gun Fiend](/wiki/Gun_Devil "Gun Devil"), during his murderous rampage and battle with Denji, Aki would end up hallucinating, perceiving everything as a snowball fight with Denji. Tragically, Aki's love for Denji proved to be the catalyst for his defeat at the hands of Denji: Aki stopped his murderous rampage after hallucinating Denji crying during the snowball fight, ceasing his deluge of snowballs (which, in truth, were bullets) because it was the first time he had ever seen Denji cry. This pause was enough to allow Denji to pierce Aki's body with his chainsaws, killing him.

The death of Aki led Denji into a deep spiral of grief and depression, with Denji losing his will to live, unable to cope with the reality that he had murdered his best friend and surrogate older brother. Denji's despair would lead him to extreme decisions, such as relinquishing his free will and subjugating himself to Makima so that he could escape the painful reality that Aki was dead by his hands.

#### [Power](/wiki/Power "Power")

Beginning as partners assigned by Makima, Denji initially viewed Power as a nuisance, whilst she attempted to use him for her own gain. Power initially betrays him, bringing him as a trade-off for the [Bat Devil](/wiki/Bat_Devil "Bat Devil") to return her [cat](/wiki/Meowy "Meowy"). After she is rescued from the Bat Devil by Denji, she apologizes and begins to warm up to him, offering him to “ fondle her chest “, as a means to apologize. Despite a rough start, their shared stupidity, apathy and hedonistic tendencies allow the two to quickly grow close, often playing games and arguing at times others would find inappropriate. Denji develops the nickname 'Powy' for her, whilst she refers to him as her 'Buddy'. Their relationship becomes comparable to that of siblings, with Denji specifically noting a lack of romantic or sexual connection between the two. Both are intensely protective of the other, as seen when Denji and Aki looked after her following the Darkness Devil attack in Hell, also protecting her physically from Aki when he was possessed by the Gun Devil. Likewise, Power agreed to take part in the hunt for the Gun Devil despite her apprehension, purely out of her desire to continue working with Denji.

Power's friendship with Denji shows when she turns into the Blood Devil against Makima, and fights her and her men. When Power is about to die after saving Denji from Makima, Power forms a contract with Denji by giving him blood in return for him finding the blood Devil again.

#### [Beam](/wiki/Beam "Beam")

They first met after being partnered up by Makima, though he offered himself as a volunteer due to being a big fan of the Chainsaw Man. They don't have much interaction with each other, but they seem to get along well. Denji allows Beam to follow him with the only condition of not being seen by people. Beam is very protective towards Denji and he will put his life on the line to save Denji. He followed Denji when he was having a "date" with Reze and quickly jumped to save him from the Bomb Devil and took him to the [Public Safety](/wiki/Devil_Hunter "Devil Hunter")'s headquarters. While being chased by the Bomb Devil and the Typhoon Devil, Denji and Beam worked together as a team in order to defeat those Devils.

#### [Nayuta](/wiki/Nayuta "Nayuta")

When he first met her, Denji was reluctant to adopt Nayuta. After talking to her, he realized she was surprisingly similar to him, like with her preferred food, and took her home. The same day, Denji got visited by [Pochita](/wiki/Pochita "Pochita") in his dream, who told him the Control Devil wanted to have a family where she was equal to someone else and advised Denji to give her lots of hugs. In Part 2, Denji calls Nayuta something between a friend and a little sister and is obsessed with collecting money for her education, confident that she is smart enough to go to college. He also describes her as a problem child with an extreme personality. Nayuta picked up a lot of mannerisms from Denji, such as her informal way of speaking and her laugh. She is also shown to care a lot for Denji despite calling him her property. as Nayuta senses Yoru due to her scent (like Makima did with Pochita and Denji in part 1), and altered Yoru/Asa's memories to keep Denji out of harm's way.

### Others

#### [Hirofumi Yoshida](/wiki/Hirofumi_Yoshida "Hirofumi Yoshida")

Denji is aloof to Yoshida and views him as a nuisance. He forgot about Yoshida's involvement in protecting him from international assassins. When Yoshida attempted to make Denji listen to him by taking away his utensils, Denji ate his food with his bare hands, dismissing Yoshida. Yoshida finds Denji perplexing but is forced to protect him under the goals of an [unknown organization](/wiki/Hirofumi_Yoshida%27s_organization "Hirofumi Yoshida's organization"). Since Yoshida knows Denji's secret identity as Chainsaw Man, Denji is more open with him than with others, openly stating his goal to "leak" his own identity to get women to fall for him, which confounds the latter. Denji let Yoshida sit on him, but only because he was being paid, and found a guy sitting on him to be uncomfortable. Yoshida also helped Denji find a girlfriend by introducing him to Asa, but not because he actually cared about Denji in any way, only for his mission to the organization.

## Abilities

### Physical Prowess

-   **Enhanced Human Condition**: Due to fusing with [Pochita](/wiki/Pochita "Pochita"), Denji gained superhuman abilities even when not transformed. In his human form, Denji is durable enough to survive being hit by Power with a hammer and getting squeezed by the Bat Devil, despite both individuals possessing immense strength.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch6Pg12-6)[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch6Pg16-7) He is also very strong, capable of decapitating a Fiend with just one swing of his Axe.[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch4Pg7-8)
    -   **Enhanced Endurance**: Due to his rough childhood, Denji has developed a high tolerance for pain and stress, being able to still function as a Devil Hunter for the Yakuza despite having multiple of his organs missing at the time. His mental fortitude has allowed him to fight for three days straight while constantly being injured[\[9\]](#cite_note-Ch19Pg1-19-9) and remaining conscious even after having multiple parts of his body cut or blown off.

### Hybrid Powers

-   **Hybrid Transformation**: By pulling on the cord emerging from his chest, Denji can transform into a bloodthirsty Chainsaw Devil.[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch1Pg40_-_42-10) Denji needs blood in order to use his abilities, so if he does not have enough of it in his body, he can not fully transform and will instead enter a pseudo-hybrid form. While Denji still has access to some of his powers in this form, they are considerably weaker and his chainsaws are shorter. If Denji runs out of blood, while already being fully transformed, his chainsaws will automatically retract themselves.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Ch19Pg1-19-9) While in this form Denji still doesn't posses [Pochita](/wiki/Pochita "Pochita")'s signature ability of Devil erasure which was proven in his fight against the [Falling Devil](/wiki/Falling_Devil "Falling Devil") which was eaten by him but neither weakened or erased.
    -   **Augmented Strength**: After entering his Hybrid form, Denji's physical strength is increased exponentially. He can break walls and kill most Devils with just one punch. On one occasion, he was able to catch a thrown car out of the air without staggering and then throw it back with an equal amount of force[\[11\]](#cite_note-Ch8Pg6_-_10-11) and on another occasion, he was capable of lifting a car and then throwing it with enough force to make it explode.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Ch69Pg17_-_18-12)
    -   **Augmented Durability**: While in his Hybrid form, Denji's physical durability is increased to inhuman levels. He can fall from great attitudes and punch Devils through walls, without receiving any injuries. He also has survived a point-blank blast from the [Bat Devil](/wiki/Bat_Devil "Bat Devil") that destroyed a building behind him,[\[13\]](#cite_note-Ch8Pg11_-_14-13) multiple explosions from the [Bomb Hybrid](/wiki/Reze "Reze"), being on fire for extended periods of time and being near the [Typhoon Devil's](/wiki/Typhoon_Devil "Typhoon Devil") tornado, which has been shown to be strong enough to lift cars. His head and chainsaws are far more durable than the rest of his body, due to being made of metal, and being capable of deflecting bullets.[\[14\]](#cite_note-Ch28Pg9-14)
    -   **Augmented Stamina**: Denji was capable of fighting the [Eternity Devil](/wiki/Eternity_Devil "Eternity Devil") for approximately three days. As long as Denji continues to drink blood to recover from his injuries, he is essentially a perpetual motion machine.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Ch19Pg1-19-9)
    -   **Chainsaw Manifestation**: As part of his transformation Denji grows fully-functional chainsaws from his arms, legs, feet and head. These chainsaws are extremely effective at cutting Devils' flesh, allowing Denji to sever limbs[\[15\]](#cite_note-Ch8Pg2-15) and bifurcate his enemies. They are also very effective at cutting other materials, such as stone and concrete,[\[16\]](#cite_note-Ch94Pg3_-_6-16) however they have shown to be incapable of cutting through metal.[\[17\]](#cite_note-Ch78Pg11-17) The chainsaws in his legs and feet are not usually active, however, Denji can employ them just by willing it. Just like the rest of his body, these chainsaws are regenerated every time Denji pulls his cord and fully transforms.
        -   **Chainsaw Retraction**: If he needs the full use of his arms and legs to do certain tasks while in his Hybrid form, Denji's chainsaws can be retracted into his body, allowing him to perform mundane actions such as grabbing objects.[\[18\]](#cite_note-Ch8Pg7_-_8-18) While Denji can willingly retract his chainsaws, they can also be retracted automatically based on his instincts alone.
        -   **Chainsaw Wall crawling**: Denji is able to manifest short chainsaws under his feet, which he can use to stick onto walls and even walk on them. He used this ability once, in order to run away from a group of dolls that were created by [Santa](/wiki/Santa_Claus "Santa Claus").[\[19\]](#cite_note-Ch68Pg2_-_4-19)
        -   **Chain Entanglement**: Denji is able to disconnect his chains from his chainsaws to use them in combat. He can wrap his chains around his opponent's body and then pull them closer to him. Denji can also wrap his chains around objects to cut them, throw them or do both.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Ch94Pg3_-_6-16) If Denji's arms get torn off but are still connected to his body, he can still use his chain like body tissue to wrap his enemies around. The chains can also be used as grapple hooks, allowing Denji to wrap them around a target and then pull his body closer to said target.[\[20\]](#cite_note-Ch94Pg13_-_14-20)
-   **Devil Transformation**: After surrendering his contract with [Pochita](/wiki/Pochita "Pochita"), Denji transformed into a Full Devil. In this form, Pochita displays incredible speed and strength, easily defeating multiple Hybrid Devils in a matter of seconds. Though he has been shown to have taken damage, and even been incapacitated by being sent to Hell and blasted into Space, these acts merely delayed him for a few minutes before he returned unscathed. His immense power is further highlighted in Hell, where it is implied that he defeated every Demon residing there. Makima stated that he has killed her 26 times in this form. This form seems to lack Denji's personality and awareness, though it has been shown to retain some memories and frequently acts in accordance with them. After being defeated by Makima to save Kobeni and later rescued by [Power](/wiki/Power "Power"), Denji transformed back to normal and regained consciousness.
-   **Blood Consumption**: Denji is able to heal completely from nearly any fatal injury, and in some instances recover from death, so long as he consumes a sufficient amount of blood. After losing his arm to [Bat Devil](/wiki/Bat_Devil "Bat Devil"), Denji's arm re-attached itself after he received a blood transfusion.[\[21\]](#cite_note-Ch11Pg1_-_2-21) With his fight against [Santa Claus](/wiki/Santa_Claus "Santa Claus"), he consumed one of her doll's blood to keep fighting while still being on fire. As a full Devil, he regenerated from just his heart after Pochita threw it from space. After noticing this method of regeneration, he is able to remove Pochita from his body and regenerate it as a separate entity which allowed him to foul Makima.
    -   **Nigh-Immortality**: Due to being a Hybrid, Denji is immortal and nearly unkillable. He can survive getting shot, being thrown from buildings and taking all kinds of injuries that would kill most Devils. Even if he dies, as long as someone pulls the cord on his chest, Denji can come back to life in perfect condition. Even after being decapitated, being cursed by the [Curse Devil](/wiki/Curse_Devil "Curse Devil") and having most of his body blown up, Denji still managed to come back to life with no lasting damage.

### Devil Contracts

-   **Chainsaw Devil Contract**: In exchange for living a "normal life", [Pochita](/wiki/Pochita "Pochita") became Denji's heart and turned him into a Hybrid. All of his Hybrid abilities are originated from this [contract](/wiki/Contract "Contract").
-   **Blood Devil Contract**: In exchange for finding reincarnated [Blood Devil](/wiki/Blood_Devil "Blood Devil") and befriending with them, [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") gave all of her blood to revive Denji.
    -   **Blood Chainsaw**: Thanks to blood gained from Power, Denji is able to manifest a chainsaw from her blood. It has similar design of Power's horns. By using her blood manipulation ability, Denji is able to disturb regeneration of Makima which allowed him to defeat her.

### Skill set

-   **Hand-to-Hand Combat**: Even without his transformation, Denji is a capable unarmed and armed fighter. Against the Leech Devil - which was many times his size and weight - he was able to easily block her blows, whilst delivering punches and headbutts with enough force to damage her.[\[22\]](#cite_note-Ch10Pg1_-_11-22) His skills improved further after training with Kishibe, in which he learnt to rely more on strategy instead of blind-strength.
    -   **Strategic Intelligence**: Despite never receiving a proper education, Denji is very perceptive when it comes to ascertaining his enemies' weaknesses and how to exploit them. Denji was trained under [Kishibe](/wiki/Kishibe "Kishibe"), who he refers to as "master" later on in the story, who teaches him various strategies. This is shown in the fight against [Katana Man](/wiki/Katana_Man "Katana Man") where Denji deceives Katana Man by making him think that Denji can only manifest chainsaws in his arms. Denji also managed to incapacitate [Reze](/wiki/Reze "Reze") by using her weakness against water and defeat [Santa Claus](/wiki/Santa_Claus "Santa Claus") by abusing her weakness towards fire and light. In the time between Parts 1 and 2 Denji has continued developing his skills, such as learning to use the chains to reattach his head and limbs after being dismembered and learning to resist mental attacks by damaging his own brain with his chainsaws as seen in the fight against the [Falling Devil](/wiki/Falling_Devil "Falling Devil").
-   **Swimming**: After meeting Reze, Denji learned how to swim. He managed to use this skill to his advantage during his fight against her.

### Weapons

-   **Super Chainsaw Man Motorcycle** (スーパーチェーンソーバイク _Sūpā Chēnsōman Baiku_?): A motorcycle enhanced by [Asa](/wiki/Asa_Mitaka "Asa Mitaka") from the motorbike stolen from a man driving on the street. This motorcycle possesses a very large chainsaw which is positioned horizontally between the two wheels. Its other notable features are a vastly upgraded engine and a black livery.

## Weaknesses

-   **Anemia**/**Low Blood Amount**: Despite being turned into a Devil Hybrid, Denji will suffer from anemia when he was fatally injured by either a shallow cut or a heavy blow, which weakens his transformation into Chainsaw Man. To counteract this, Denji must consume a copious amount of blood to refill his strength.

## Etymology

Denji's name is likely an allusion to Kudou Denji, the protagonist of the manga _[Abara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abara "wikipedia:Abara")_, which Fujimoto has cited as an inspiration for _Chainsaw Man_.

## Trivia

-   Denji's rankings in the [Popularity Polls](/wiki/Popularity_Polls "Popularity Polls") are as follows:
    -   Denji ranked 5th in the First Popularity Poll with 18,302 votes.
    -   Denji ranked 4th in the Second Popularity Poll with 59,130 votes.
-   Denji appears in the background of [My Hero Academia](https://myheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/My_Hero_Academia_Wiki "w:c:myheroacademia:My Hero Academia Wiki") [Chapter 259](https://myheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_259 "w:c:myheroacademia:Chapter 259").
-   Fujimoto revealed that his favorite character is Denji.
-   Before becoming a Hybrid, Denji suffered from a heart disease that he inherited from his mother. The disease caused him to vomit blood regularly and even managed to kill his mother. The disease is very likely [mitral stenosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_stenosis "wikipedia:Mitral stenosis").
-   He is similar to the main character, Akira, of the series Devilman. Both are Devil and human Hybrids who became "superheroes" that take on the moniker of -Man relating to the Devil they fused with and the titles of their respective series. They both have their own Devil forms they switch between as a result of their fusions. Denji's dynamic with Makima was also similar to how the demon Silene/Sirene lured Akira but only because she wanted the demon she either admired or was in love with (depending on the version) that he fused with, Amon, and wanted to kill Akira. Only difference is Makima is more of a major character and has a more major impact on Denji.
    -   Some translations use the term Devilman/Devilmen for Fiends, which is often seen as hinting at obvious inspirations for the series itself. Later on in the story, Denji gets called a "Devil-human" by a news reporter in Chapter 103.

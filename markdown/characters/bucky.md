## Appearance

Bucky appears as a headless chicken with a bow tie. He is able to speak despite the lack of a head.

## Personality

Bucky has a cheerful personality, constantly joking and trying to get along with the students. Despite being a Devil, he shows absolutely no antagonism or hostility to humans, though he does mention he’d have no hope of surviving on his own, which may hint at the pragmatism of being friendly.

## Plot

### History

At some point, [Tanaka](/wiki/Tanaka "Tanaka") captured or otherwise acquired Bucky to become a class pet.

### [Justice Devil arc](/wiki/Justice_Devil_arc "Justice Devil arc")

At Fourth East High School, [Mr. Tanaka](/wiki/Tanaka "Tanaka") presents Bucky as a class pet, telling the students that in 3 months, they would kill and eat him. Over time, Bucky became a beloved pet to the class, and at the deadline of his death, they refused to kill him, despite him being a Devil, to Tanaka's elation, saying the real lesson was to value all life. [Asa Mitaka](/wiki/Asa_Mitaka "Asa Mitaka") tried to carry him to join in at recess due to him remembering her name, giving her clarity that the class does care for her. However, Asa trips and falls on top of Bucky, collapsing his torso and exposing his entrails. Bucky would be buried in a grave, and Asa became a victim of her classmates' bullying due to this incident. Afterward, it was revealed that the [Class President](/wiki/Class_President "Class President") tripped Asa under orders from the [Justice Devil](/wiki/Justice_Devil "Justice Devil"), and make Asa take all the blame for Bucky's death.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch98-1)

## Abilities

As a Devil, the Chicken Devil possesses all of the standard [Devil abilities](/wiki/Devil#General_Abilities "Devil"). However, since chickens are not very frightening to humans, Bucky is not very strong, showing no unique abilities. Unlike the superficially similar [Pig](/wiki/Pig_Devil "Pig Devil") and [Fish Devils](/wiki/Fish_Devil "Fish Devil"), Bucky has a normal human-level intelligence and the capacity for speech which allows him to interact with humans.

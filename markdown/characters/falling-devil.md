## Appearance

Upon arriving on Earth, she assembled herself a form out of mangled human corpses. Upon appearing on Earth, she takes the form of a large, big-breasted, feminine, and headless humanoid made of corpses with hands for feet and a pointed tendril covering the groin. This also seems to be her true form, as demonstrated by the miniature version of herself she turns into when not active.

In addition to two multi-jointed arms, she has a pair of scythe-like limbs that resemble featherless wings and two more pairs of arms sprouting from her back. One pair holds a decapitated head with a black ponytail; blood drips out of the ever-closed eyes, nostrils and mouth.

Her most notable trait is her chef uniform, which consists of a tall toque, black leggings, long, black gloves, a white chef jacket, and a black waist apron.

## Personality

The Falling Devil appears to view herself as being subservient to the wishes of other [Devils](/devil "Devil"), often announcing that her goals and desires are that of Hell as a whole. Despite this, she doesn't seem above the idea of serving death to fellow Devils should they not respect her own established conditions.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch123Pg3-1) She also appears to have some degree of animosity towards the [War Devil](/yoru "Yoru") as she chose to target her specifically.

Much like her appearance, Falling Devil speaks similarly to a chef as well, describing her different attacks as “courses” that will “delight your tastebuds”, whilst insisting people finish their trauma-laden meal. Falling Devil also appears to have a form of humility to her, such as when she covered herself up after noticing her own nudity.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch123Pg2-2) Despite being a devil, she will only attack humans if they're necessary "ingredients" (and opts to leave them injured instead of dead whenever possible) for her dishes or in self-defense. She claims to dislike meaningless slaughter and was reluctant to fight Denji, preferring to work on her dish instead.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch125Pg7-3) She takes great pride in the "meals" she prepares, so much that, if they aren't eaten or are ill-received, she loses her composure and kills those who don't enjoy her food.

The Falling Devil is generally polite. Perhaps due to her nigh-immortality, she expresses only mild irritation or impatience at attackers, seeing them as mere inconveniences. Even after being attacked by the [Chainsaw Man](/denji "Denji") himself, she doesn't take him seriously and instead cracks a joke. She appears to be mentally mature and well-mannered for a devil, as she responds with disgust to Denji's sexual comments towards [Asa](/asa-mitaka "Asa Mitaka").

The Falling Devil is also very cruel, preferring to break her victims emotionally and mentally until they decide to commit suicide, rather than killing them herself straight away.

As shown, due to coming under [Fami](/fami "Fami")’s control, the Falling Devil is very loyal towards her. As shown where she apologised to her for failing to successfully put Asa/War into a starved state as her master desired and later, willingly allowed herself to turn into a figurine for Fami to pick up.

## Plot

### [Current arc](/current-arc "Current arc")

Soon after arriving on Earth at East District's Tamano Apartments, she starts influencing the humans living there into committing suicide. [Asa Mitaka](/asa-mitaka "Asa Mitaka") is caught up in this, however, she is saved from harming herself thanks to [Yoru](/yoru "Yoru") taking over.

She assembles a body for herself out of the human corpses lying around while Yoru flees the scene. After attaching a head to herself she notices that she is naked and covers herself up with a chef's uniform. She reveals her name and proclaims she'll be the chef tonight at the request of Hell's residents.

She announces the first course to be _"Hors d'oeuvre, La Root Vonla"_ and claps her hands, causing Asa to have a traumatic flashback. Soon after, due to her power, countless people start flying up into the air with some of them going into floating doors leading to [Hell](/hell "Hell") to be devoured. While Asa and Yoru argue with each other she kills multiple devil hunters and serves one as _"De Root Atelanta"_ to an unnamed devil in hell. She announces it's almost time for the main dish _"Asa Root Yoru"_ in which she plans to serve [Asa](/asa-mitaka "Asa Mitaka") and [Yoru](/yoru "Yoru") as fodder to hell's residents.

The Falling Devil tears through the town to collect ingredients for the dish, taking ten eyes and four ears from humans. She then goes to the supermarket to pick some apples to pair with the flesh, even sparing the terrified employee. After leaving the supermarket, the Falling Devil remembers that the recipe for the sauce requires a man's head. Just as she begins looking for one, a group of Devil Hunters with snipers open fire completely destroying her body. Their attempt to kill the devil fails as she regenerates, stating that it is impossible to kill her with any and all means of attack humanity presently possesses. She "politely" requests the devil hunters to stop and give her a head, but instead, she is once again attacked. Annoyed, she uses her ability to obliterate the area around her. Amidst the chaos she quickly beheads one of the devil hunters and takes their head.

The Falling Devil prepares to move on to make Asa fall to complete the dish, but she is ambushed by [Chainsaw Man](/denji "Denji"), who tears through her body. While she is taken by surprise, the Falling Devil eventually emerges victorious and goes after Asa again, this time meeting her face to face. The Devil makes Asa fall and grabs her, remarking how her attachment to life is weak. She then tells Asa to close her eyes for a peaceful fall and she complies, but is briefly caught by Denji however he is unsuccessful and both of them fall into [Hell](/hell "Hell"). As Denji's about to flee Hell through one of the doors, she blocks his way and demands him to put her down, lest he won't be let out. She is suddenly attacked from behind by a Chainsaw Man [look-alike](/fake-chainsaw-man "Fake Chainsaw Man") which prompts her to observe that she did get ambushed quite a lot this day. The enigmatic figure holds her down which allows Denji and Asa to escape.

She soon returns; now frustrated and uses her abilities to throw an entire apartment building towards Denji and Asa as they make their escape. Their bike effortlessly carves through the building however it temporarily obstructs their view allowing another devil to surprise them. She knocks them off their vehicle and the two are eaten by the devil. However due to interference from [Nayuta](/nayuta "Nayuta") the devil hastly vomits both of them back up. Falling explodes with anger due to her dish being disgraced and obliterates the devil with an energy beam. [Fami](/fami "Fami") arrives and Falling bows to her apologizing for her failure. Fami orders her to "return" which transforms her into a miniature figurine of herself which Famine then collects.

## Abilities

Being a Primal Fear, the Falling Devil is described as a transcendent being; one of the devils embodying a primal fear and has never experienced death due to being so powerful. As a devil that embodies a primal fear, it can be assumed that the Falling Devil is almost as old as humanity itself. However despite her power she somehow managed to fall under the [Famine Devil](/fami "Fami") control. As a Devil, the Falling Devil possesses all of the standard [devil abilities](/devil#general-abilities "Devil").

### Devil Powers

-   **Nigh-Absolute Immortality**: As a primal fear, the Falling Devil cannot be killed with any conventional means.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch125Pg7-3) Presumably, a strong supernatural weapon such as those created by [Asa](/asa-mitaka "Asa Mitaka") or [Angel](/angel-devil "Angel Devil") would be necessary to deal any permanent damage, or with [Pochita](/pochita "Pochita")'s erasure ability.

-   **Hell Connection**: The Falling Devil can freely manifest multiple doors that connect directly to [Hell](/hell "Hell"). This allows her to send certain individuals to Hell as well as travel freely between the two realms herself.

![Falling destroys a city](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/chainsaw-man/images/6/66/Falling_destroys_a_city.png "Falling destroys a city.png")

[](/file:falling-destroys-a-city.png)

Falling Devil destroys multiple city blocks.

-   **Gravity Manipulation**: The Falling Devil can selectively manipulate gravity on herself, the environment or individual people. The strength and direction of the manipulated gravity can be changed by simply pointing her finger in that direction.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch127Pg1-4) This ability includes:
    -   **Traumatic Anti-Gravity**: The Falling Devil possesses an ability that allows her to invert gravity on people, causing them to fall up into the sky. The force of reversed gravity is related to a person’s past and trauma, with those who have suffered little to no trauma being barely affected. Upon reaching a certain height, the person falls into a door to [Hell](/hell "Hell").
    -   **Levitation**: The Falling Devil can use the gravity manipulation ability on herself to freely move in any direction and at high speeds. She can also suspend herself in the air and keep herself stationary.
    -   **Area Denial**: The Falling Devil can fully reverse gravity in its immediate vicinity, completely destroying the area.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch125Pg9-5) She later used this ability again to force Asa out of her hiding spot.
    -   **Targeted Control**: The Falling Devil can also focus her power on a singular object and manipulate it's gravity to her will. She used this ability to lift up and entire apartment building high into the air and then launch it towards the fleeing Denji and Asa.
-   **Energy Beam**: With a pointing gesture the Falling Devil can summon a powerful beam of energy. She used this ability to instantly kill a very strong devil.
-   **Thought Manipulation**: Falling Devil can force its victims to relive traumatic memories in their minds. This ability complements her gravity manipulation which is tied to a victim's past trauma. However, this power can be resisted if the victim's brain is damaged, as Denji stopped falling after slicing his brain up.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch126Pg8-6)
    -   **Emotion Manipulation**: As shown when Asa began becoming affected by its power, the Falling Devil possess the power to draw out and magnify the negative feelings of her victims, causing them to become more inclined to her manipulating their thoughts such as making people commit suicide.

-   **Body Control**: Aside from controlling her own vessel made out of human corpses, she appears to be able to force humans to move against their will, as seen by her forcing a devil hunter to sit in an unnaturally contorted position.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch124Pg13-7)

-   **Object Creation**: The Falling Devil is able to summon/create various objects at will such as her chef's uniform and various restaurant-related utilities.

### Physical Prowess

-   **Immense Strength**: Kicks from the Falling Devil can send [Denji](/denji "Denji") flying into buildings with enough force to demolish them.[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch126Pg1-8) Her scythelike limbs are sharp enough to cleanly decapitate humans. Notably, she stopped a dashing Chainsaw Man with a single finger.[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)
-   **Immense Speed**: The Falling Devil is able to move around very quickly, beheading someone in mid-air and was[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch125Pg11-10) also precise enough to pluck multiple eyes and ears from passersby without further injuring them.
-   **Immense Healing Factor**: The Falling Devil can completely regenerate from any attack no matter how severe the damage to her body is. This regeneration seems to be automatic and is seemingly limitless with no stamina cost. The regeneration is so violent and sudden that Denji was ripped apart simply by being in her way while she was regenerating.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Ch126Pg11-11)

### Weaknesses

-   **Low Durability**: The Falling Devil's body is quite fragile and can be easily destroyed by gunfire and Denji's chainsaws. This isn't enough to kill her due to her immortality and immense healing factor, however it leaves her temporarily incapacitated. This gives her enemies a small window of time to escape or recuperate while she waits to regenerate.

## Dishes

Dishes served by the Falling Devil so far are:

-   **Hors d'oeuvre, La Root Vonla** (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>前</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ぜん</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>菜</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>さい</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> 　ラ・<ruby lang="ja"><rb>根</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ね</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> ・ヴォンラ, _Zensai: Ra ne Vonra_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")): The "appetizer". It consists of random people who were sent to hell with her gravity inversion ability.
-   **De Root Atelanta** (デ・<ruby lang="ja"><rb>根</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ね</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> ・アテランタ, _De ne Ateranta_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")): The "soup course". It's a potage made from the ears, nose, and tongue of several devil hunters alongside an alive devil hunter. She delivers him and the soup to hell where he's devoured by a huge caterpillar-like devil.

![Asa Root Yoru](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/chainsaw-man/images/6/6e/Asa_Root_Yoru.png "Asa Root Yoru.png")

[](/file:asa-root-yoru.png)

Asa served as a dish on a big plate

Failed dishes:

-   **Asa Root Yoru** (アサ・<ruby lang="ja"><rb>根</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ね</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> ・ヨル, _Asa ne Yoru_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")): The "main course, a human and war devil mix". Its primary ingredients include [Asa](/asa-mitaka "Asa Mitaka") and [Yoru](/yoru "Yoru") served with sauce. As for the sauce it consists of apples, a man's head, ten eyes, and four ears.  
    However after being served, Asa was promptly rescued by [Denji](/denji "Denji") before any devil could eat her.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Ch128Pg5-12)

## Trivia

-   The meaning of "**La Root Vonla**" is currently unclear. However, the Spanish translation words this as _La Degustación del Trauma_ (The Tasting of Trauma).
-   The featherless wings in the Falling Devil's design have ironic symbolism. Wings are used for flight, yet are useless without feathers.
    -   They could also symbolize a fallen angel.
-   The Falling Devil's outfit, attitude, and dominating claps are a reference to Slowik, the main antagonist of "The Menu," a movie that came out one day after chapter [111](/chapter-111 "Chapter 111") and one that Fujimoto reportedly liked.
    -   The way she manifests on Earth resembles a scene in "Berserk," where Slan, one of the most powerful demonic beings in existence, manifests herself in another world through spilled troll guts.
-   In one panel, the Falling Devil's gravitokinesis uproots a tree. This feat would require an acceleration of about 60 m/s².
-   Given the reveal of being controlled by the Famine Devil, that would explain the cook/food motif the Falling Devil had.

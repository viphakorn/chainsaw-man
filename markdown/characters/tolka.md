## Appearance

Tolka is a tall, plain-looking man with light hair and pale eyes. When he goes hunting he dons a hoodie and a quiver on his back.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch54Pg1-1)

## Personality

Tolka has been conditioned to believe that taking a life is not a serious matter thanks to his hunting trips with his [master](/wiki/Santa_Claus "Santa Claus"). After being questioned on whether or not he can kill a sixteen-year old boy like an animal, Tolka affirms that he can kill.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch54Pg1_-_6-2)

Tolka is devoted to his master; being willing to kill another person so that she could retire peacefully, as well as wiping her mouth when she eats.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch54Pg1_-_6-2)

## Plot

### [International Assassins arc](/wiki/International_Assassins_arc "International Assassins arc")

Tolka and his master are hunting the woods when they come across a fox which he shoots with an arrow. He questions the point of the hunt they're on while his master repeatedly asks him whether he thinks he has taken a life or not. They return to their cottage and cook the fox. His master reveals that their next job is not a job to hunt a devil but to hunt and kill a sixteen-year old boy, much like the fox they have just hunted and killed. Tolka swears to his master that he can kill. He makes a promise to her that since she has just half a year left to live that he wants her to live her remaining days in a peaceful retirement.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch54Pg1_-_6-2)

Later in Japan Tolka's master discretely stabs [Denji](/wiki/Denji "Denji") three times with a nail and drops it in front of Tolka who is sitting at a nearby table. She explains the details of her contract with the [Curse Devil](/wiki/Curse_Devil "Curse Devil") and entrusts the fourth and final stab to Tolka.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch56Pg4_-_9-3)

Tolka and his master go hunting after Denji.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch59Pg1-4) Tolka looks at the nail in his hand as he prepares to entry the battle.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch59Pg21-5)

Tolka disguises himself among the dead dolls created by the [Doll Devil](/wiki/Doll_Devil "Doll Devil") and plants the nail on the floor which Denji steps on. Denji rises into the air and is violently killed by the Curse Devil as [Beam](/wiki/Beam "Beam") looks on in shock. Tolka then stands up and kicks Beam in the face.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch62Pg16_-_19-6)

His Master comes to congratulate Tolka and states that he is now part of the family. He is then turned into a doll after being touched by his Master. He is sent to hell along with the Devil Hunters via Santa Claus's contract with the Hell Devil. Now under control of the Doll Devil, he states to the Darkness Devil that he has brought the Chainsaw's heart in exchange for the power to kill Makima. He is subsequently decapitated by the Darkness Devil.

## Abilities

### Skillset

**Archery**: Tolka is a proficient archer, able to kill a fox from a distance with his bow and arrow.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch54Pg1-1)

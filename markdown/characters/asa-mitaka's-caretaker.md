[Chapter 123](/wiki/Chapter_123 "Chapter 123")

  
**Asa's caretaker** worked at the orphanage that [Asa](/wiki/Asa_Mitaka "Asa Mitaka") and other children were sent to after their parents died because of [Devils](/wiki/Devil "Devil"). She herself claimed that she lost her mother because of the [Typhoon Devil](/wiki/Typhoon_Devil "Typhoon Devil"), just like Asa, though whether or not this was an attempt to manipulate Asa is unclear.

She noticed that Asa was using her cat, Crambon, for companionship instead of befriending the other orphans and told her she had a friend who owned numeral cats. Convinced that her cat would be happier at such a place, Asa entrusted him to the caretaker. As it turned out, she was envious that Asa still had somewhat of a family while she and the other orphans didn't and drowned Crambon in the nearby river.

## Appearance

She was a woman of average height and build, with dark eyes and black hair that she kept tied in a bun. She wore a bright-colored shirt, black pants and an apron.

## Personality

On the surface, the caretaker seemed kind and empathetic, seemingly wanting the best for everyone. However, in truth, she was a manipulative, jealous, and bitter sociopath who intentionally lured an orphaned girl into a false sense of security only to take away her one remaining source of happiness.

The caretaker reveals her true nature

## Plot

### [Current Arc](/wiki/Current_arc "Current arc")

As the [Falling Devil](/wiki/Falling_Devil "Falling Devil") appears on Earth, she intensifies people's negative feelings and lets them experience their traumas again. Gravity gets reversed for people with heavy hearts, making them fall upwards and through a door to [Hell](/wiki/Hell "Hell"), where they get sacrificed to Hell's residents. [Asa](/wiki/Asa_Mitaka "Asa Mitaka"), whose emotions were already affected by the Falling Devil, has a flashback to her childhood at the orphanage, where she relives her trauma. Asa wakes up in the present and desperately holds on to a railing as she ascends, with [Yoru](/wiki/Yoru "Yoru") yelling at her not to be afraid.

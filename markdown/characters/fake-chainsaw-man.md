## Appearance

He appears to be an exceptionally tall male and has a rather bulky physique. His face was never shown and as such the details of his appearance and whether this is a transformed state or his original appearance currently remain unknown. Large chainsaws emerge from his forehead and arms; much longer than [Denji](/wiki/Denji "Denji")'s. Additionally as seen in the shadow, in his transformed state his head is also morphed into a demonic, mechanical shape with long, jagged fangs, similar to that of Denji's or [Pochita](/wiki/Pochita "Pochita")'s devilish forms, though lacking Denji's top handle and Pochita's horns.

## Personality

Not much is known about his personality except that he speaks in a formal, polite, and calm manner. His actions so far hint at him wanting to help the real Chainsaw Man however he can. He also seems very knowledgeable about the Devils in Hell.

## Plot

### [Justice Devil arc](/wiki/Justice_Devil_arc "Justice Devil arc")

[![Yuko beheaded by a mysterious figure](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/chainsaw-man/images/9/9b/Yuko_beheaded_by_a_mysterious_figure.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/171?cb=20230509165958)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/chainsaw-man/images/9/9b/Yuko_beheaded_by_a_mysterious_figure.png/revision/latest?cb=20230509165958)

[](/wiki/File:Yuko_beheaded_by_a_mysterious_figure.png)

Yuko is beheaded by the enigmatic copycat.

After [Yuko](/wiki/Yuko "Yuko") says her goodbyes to [Asa](/wiki/Asa_Mitaka "Asa Mitaka"), she sets of an a journey to find her [Devil Hunter](/wiki/Devil_Hunter "Devil Hunter") relative, seeking to find a way to return to a human form. She tried to get some rest on the rooftop of one of the buildings. He takes the opportunity to behead her in her sleep, presumably killing her.

### [Current arc](/wiki/Current_arc "Current arc")

As the [Falling Devil](/wiki/Falling_Devil "Falling Devil") blocks the way for Denji's and Asa's escape out of [Hell](/wiki/Hell "Hell"), he appears behind her, tearing her apart and incapacitating her. He explains to Denji that the Falling Devil does not tolerate customers who don't finish their food, and as a result, the rest of the [devils](/wiki/Devil "Devil") in Hell will desperately try to devour Asa in order to satisfy her demands. He then asks Chainsaw Man to evade the other devils until sunrise.

## Abilities

In general, he seems to be very powerful, as he has no qualms facing a member of the [Primal Fears](/wiki/Devil#Primal_Devils "Devil"). Not much is known about the nature his abilities, however they are likely similar to those of Denji's hybrid powers. These abilities include:

### Supernatural Powers

-   **Chainsaw Manifestation**: Just like his original counterpart, he grows fully-functional chainsaws from his arms and head. These chainsaws are extremely effective at cutting Devils' flesh as seen in when he ambushed the Falling Devil. It is unknown whether he can extend chainsaws from his legs like Denji can.
    -   Just like Denji he can also temporarily retract his chainsaws if he needs to do certain tasks, such as picking something up.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch111Pg17-1)

### Physical Prowess

-   **Enhanced Strength**: He is shown to easily hold up Yuko's entire body with just one hand. Later after he incapacitated the Falling Devil he lifts her up as well, holding up her entire body weight with just his neck.

## Appearance

The Zombie Devil takes the form of a giant floating limbless torso with multiple exposed organs including a brain from which tentacles emerge to connect him to zombies within his horde. A large human-like face emerges from the right side of the devil's torso unconnected to where its head should be.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch1Pg22-1) During the fight with [Denji](/denji "Denji"), he loses his right Eye and is later cut into two halves.

## Personality

The Zombie Devil has a greater hatred towards humans, particularly towards devil hunters.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch1Pg22_-_23-2) Since devil hunters kill his own kind, the Zombie Devil seeks to kill devil hunters in return.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch1Pg24-3) He appears to be somewhat cunning, since he managed to trick the Yakuza and turn them into zombies.

## Plot

### [Intro arc](/intro-arc "Intro arc")

The Zombie Devil made a deal with a mafia group to lend them his power, but since his power turns people into zombies, they became his servants. He then called [Denji](/denji "Denji") to an abandoned building and made his new zombies kill him, since he hates [devil hunters](/devil-hunter "Devil Hunter").[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch1Pg18_-_25-4)

When Denji came back to life, he was surprised that he still lived and told his zombies to eat him. As Denji transformed into Chainsaw Man, he minced his zombies. The Zombie Devil thought that the smaller devil took over his body and that he should be one of them, but Denji launched towards him and “killed” him by jamming his chainsaw into the Zombie Devil's head.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch1Pg37_-_45-5)

### [Katana Man arc](/katana-man-arc "Katana Man arc")

Despite being killed by Denji, the Zombie Devil's creations continued to exist as a threat, implying that he is still alive, presumably under Makima's control. An army of zombies was left behind by the mafia group and were used by [Katana Man](/katana-man "Katana Man") and [Akane Sawatari](/akane-sawatari "Akane Sawatari") to attack the [fourth division](/tokyo-special-division-4 "Tokyo Special Division 4").[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch32Pg18_-_19-6)

### [Control Devil arc](/control-devil-arc "Control Devil arc")

The Zombie Devil is summoned by [Makima](/makima "Makima") while [Power](/power "Power") is trying to escape with Denji from her. Thanks to his ability, Makima is able to turn Devil Hunters under her control into zombies.

## Abilities

As a Devil, the Zombie Devil possesses all of the standard [devil abilities](/devil#general-abilities "Devil"), such the ability to make contracts with humans for a price. Since zombies are common horror monsters in movies and pop culture, it can be assumed that he is quite powerful.

The only known contract is the one with the [japanese mafia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza "wikipedia:Yakuza"). In exchange for an unknown price, the Zombie Devil agreed to lend his power to the Yakuza. However since his power is to turn people into zombies, they ended up becoming zombies themselves.

### Devil Powers

-   **Zombie Creation**: The Zombie Devil has the power to turn humans into zombies, who are forced to act as his loyal servants.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch1Pg22-1) Humans who are bitten by zombies are transformed into zombies themselves.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch32Pg18_-_19-6) Zombies are able to move and attack even if they are heavily injured, making them tougher than normal humans.
-   **Blood Consumption**: Like all the devils, the Zombie Devil should be able to restore his health by consuming blood.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch1Pg13-7) After being cut in half by Denji, the Zombie Devil was presumably able to heal his injuries after being given blood.

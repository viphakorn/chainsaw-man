## Appearance

Kurose is a man with short black hair who tends to wear the standard Public Safety Devil Extermination uniform. He has a horizontal scar across his face which is a feature he shares with [Michiko Tendo](/michiko-tendo "Michiko Tendo").[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch26Pg16-1)

## Personality

Like Tendo, Kurose is nervous around Makima and insists that he doesn't want to join the special division.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch29Pg19-2)

Kurose has a noticeable accent which he tends to tone down around people from Tokyo.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch55Pg18_-_19-3)

## Plot

### History

Kurose's life was ruined by the [Gun Devil](/gun-devil "Gun Devil") which was his motivation for joining Public Safety though he never tried to kill it himself, believing it to be impossible.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch33Pg4-4)

### [Katana Man arc](/katana-man-arc "Katana Man arc")

Yutaro and Michiko were waiting at a train station in Kyoto for Makima's arrival when they received word that Makima had been killed on the train in an ambush. Makima disembarks the train covered in blood but unharmed. When the two of them ask Makima if she was shot, Makima simply responds that she wasn't hit.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch26Pg16_-_19-5)

Yutaro asks Makima if they should go to Tokyo to assist the rest of the Special Division but Makima tells them that they won't be able to make it in time so they'll assist from their current location. She tells Kurose to borrow thirty convicts who are serving life sentences or worse.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch27Pg1_-_2-6) They travel to a nearby shrine with Makima and are both blindfolded while she carries out her attack on the terrorists; Yutaro wonders why they need to be blindfolded and Michiko tells him that ordinary devil hunters aren't authorized to know which devils she is contracted with. Once Makima is finished she tells them to remove their blindfolds and that she's returning to Tokyo.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch27Pg10_-_19-7)

As they arrive in Tokyo they are met by [Madoka](/madoka "Madoka") who passes on a message to Makima and resigns. Yutaro and Michiko look at each other nervously and remind Makima that they don't want to join the special division and that they'll only be around for a week to help with training.[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch28Pg14_-_19-8)

Yutaro and Michiko travel to the hospital to meet Aki who is recovering after his battle with the [Katana Man](/katana-man "Katana Man"). They introduced themselves and stated they were here at Makima's request to train the Special Division 4.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Ch29Pg14-9)

Yutaro informs Aki that he has gotten on the Fox Devil's bad side and won't be able to summon him anymore. After seeing Aki's commitment, him and Michiko decide to leave and come back the next day with paperwork so that Aki can make a contract with a stronger division. On his way out Kurose informs Aki that someone else is there to see him.[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch30Pg9_-_14-10)

Yutaro and Michiko lead Aki to an underground facility where devils are kept by Public Safety. Kurose asked if the woman who visited Aki in the hospital was his girlfriend but Aki tells him she was just his buddy's younger sister who came by to give him letters written by [Himeno](/himeno "Himeno"). They arrive at a cell which contains the [Future Devil](/future-devil "Future Devil") which has contracts with two other Public Safety devil hunters.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Ch31Pg12_-_17-11)

Yutaro and Michiko drop Aki off by car once he's made his deal with the Future Devil, and plan to go sightseeing before returning to Kyoto. He talks in the car to Aki about how unrealistic it is to think of killing the Gun Devil and how annoying he finds Aki but ultimately he throws Aki a can of Coca-Cola and leaves him with a final piece of advice that everybody in the Special Division is insane so he should watch out.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Ch33Pg1_-_7-12)

### [International Assassins arc](/international-assassins-arc "International Assassins arc")

Yutaro, Michiko and another devil hunter from Kyoto named Subaru were summoned to Tokyo to be additional guards for Denji.[\[13\]](#cite_note-Ch55Pg4-13) In the car ride there, Subaru asks about Makima since they've both met her before, but before Michiko can say anything a set of road spikes are thrown in front of their car, causing them to crash. As Yutaro wonders what made them crash, three American devil hunters break the car windows, and fatally shoot Yutaro, Michiko and Subaru. The devil hunters then use their contract with the [Skin Devil](/skin-devil "Skin Devil") in order to impersonate Yutaro's appearance.[\[14\]](#cite_note-Ch55Pg7_-_19-14)

## Abilities

### Devil Contracts

-   **Punishment Contract**: Kurose had a contract with the [Punishment Devil](/punishment-devil "Punishment Devil") for an unknown price.

### Hybrid Form

When transformed, the Flamethrower Hybrid has his head transformed into three huge fuel tanks while his neck becomes a jumble of metal parts. The Flamethrower Devil Hybrid's arms transform into giant flamethrowers that serve to attack his enemies.

Hybrid Form

## Personality

The Flamethrower Hybrid's real personality is currently unknown, as he was brainwashed and mind-controlled by Makima. He was shown to be observant enough to notice Denji's weakened state, and displayed a rather manic side when blowing up an entire building using his flamethrowers.

## Plot

### [Control Devil arc](/wiki/Control_Devil_arc "Control Devil arc")

At an unknown point in time, the Flamethrower Hybrid was brainwashed by Makima to serve her needs. He is summoned as part of Makima's newly-formed [Special Division 5](/wiki/Tokyo_Special_Division_5 "Tokyo Special Division 5"), a team of weapon hybrids created for the sole purpose of battling the fully-powered [Chainsaw Devil](/wiki/Chainsaw_Devil "Chainsaw Devil").[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch86Pg14-15-1) While under Makima's control, he comments about how everyone in the group adores Makima.

Once Makima commands Special Division 5 to attack, each member activates their weapon trigger, transforming into their Hybrid forms. They all leap from their respective spots to lunge straight towards Chainsaw Man. Before any of the Hybrids can land a single blow on him, they are all blown back by Chainsaw Man leaping forward from the building he stood on to initiate the fight.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch87Pg4-9-2)

After Chainsaw Man beheads [Katana Man](/wiki/Katana_Man "Katana Man"), the Flamethrower Hybrid appears on the bottom floor and aims his two flamethrowers at the ceiling. Screaming in excitement, he unleashes a large torrent of flames, creating a large explosion that forces Chainsaw Man to escape the building. He is eventually torn to shreds alongside the remaining Special Division 5 members after Chainsaw Man withstands their combined attack of sending him into space.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch88Pg5-17-3)

At some point in the future, Special Division 5's Hybrids are revived once more by Makima, who brings them all to a graveyard to confront Denji.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch93Pg12-13-4) Once Makima finishes monologuing her thoughts of erasing anything she dislikes to Pochita (who is disguised as Denji), the Flamethrower Hybrid and the other Weapon Humans transform into their Hybrid forms for the final battle.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch93Pg18-19-5)

During this confrontation, he attempts to burn down Pochita once the latter is piled up by a group of zombies from the [Zombie Devil](/wiki/Zombie_Devil "Zombie Devil"). Unfortunately, Pochita uses his chain whips to latch onto two grave markers, and launches himself straight towards Makima's group using his chainsaws to slice the Flamethrower Hybrid in half.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch94Pg10-15-6)

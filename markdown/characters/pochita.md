## Appearance

### Devil Form

#### Near-death State

After disappearing from his battle with the [Four Horsemen](/wiki/Four_Horsemen "Four Horsemen") and [Weapon Devils](/wiki/Weapon_Devils "Weapon Devils"), Pochita is reduced to a “near-death state”. In this state, he appears to be a small orange canine-like Devil with a chainsaw-like appendage protruding from the center of his head. Handles emerge from his body allowing him to be wielded like a chainsaw, and his short tail is in the shape of a chainsaw's pull cord.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch1Pg1_-_3-1)

#### Normal

His true Devil form is of a large, humanoid Devil with four arms and a chainsaw protruding from each, with another chainsaw coming from the front of his head, similar to Denji's hybrid form. An intestine still connected to his stomach is wrapped around his neck, resembling a scarf or a collar.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch83Pg16_-_19-2)

### Hybrid Form

After making a contract with Denji, Pochita assimilates himself with him, fusing with his heart and becoming part of Denji's anatomy, thus creating a hybrid. This allows Denji to become [Chainsaw Man](/wiki/Denji#Transformed "Denji") by pulling the chainsaw cord in his chest. In this state, Pochita is smaller, has lost the chainsaw on his head, all his appendages and both handles. Pochita also has blood vessels connected to Denji. Pochita however still retains his trademark cute canine face. Denji's chainsaw cord is also directly connected to the top of Pochita's head.

Un-weakened Devil Form

## Personality

Unlike most Devils Pochita communicated solely through barks and whines like an actual dog.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch1Pg10_-_17-3) However, after fusing with Denji, he is able to communicate telepathically with him. He continuously communicates with Denji through dreams, warning him to not 'open the door'.

Pochita deeply cared for [Denji](/wiki/Denji "Denji") after his life was saved by the human, despite the Devil's general hatred toward humankind. He willingly gave up his heart to Denji so that he could fulfill his dreams which Pochita loved hearing about.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch1Pg32_-_36-4) He also showed that he knows Denji very well and is able to mimic Denji\`s personality and behavior to fool Makima.[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)

Pochita exhibits a more erratic personality when in his true Devil form, as shown when he quickly murders anyone who expressed even the slight bit of hostility towards him in the burger joint. However, even in this state he remembers his friend Denji's wish of trying a hamburger that isn't rotten and going on a date with a girl, which leads him to kidnap Kobeni.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch86-6) Later, he tells Denji that he always dreamed of being hugged, but his strength made that impossible, implying that his murder spree at the burger joint was accidental due to him being unable to properly control his strength around others.

He also seems to answer the calls of help from humans and Devils alike, proven when he saved both [Makima](/wiki/Makima "Makima") and [Kobeni](/wiki/Kobeni_Higashiyama "Kobeni Higashiyama") from their problematic situations, though he later brutally assaulted the former after completing his task.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch86-6)[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch86Pg8-7) Despite this, his love for Denji remained, as he was keen to fulfill his friend's dreams, and later even sacrificed himself to save Kobeni.[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch86Pg16-8)[\[9\]](#cite_note-Ch89Pg18-9)

## Abilities

Being regarded as the Devil that Devils fear the most, The Chainsaw Devil is considered one the most powerful entities in the series after the [Primordial Devils](/wiki/Darkness_Devil "Darkness Devil"), being able to fend off hordes of Devils in Hell unscathed. The hunt for his heart alone was enough to cause an international conflict, and even Makima, one of the Four Horsemen, considered herself inferior to him, needing the public's adoration to weaken and defeat him.

As a Devil, the Chainsaw Devil possesses all of the standard [Devil abilities](/wiki/Devil#General_Abilities "Devil"). These include the ability to make contracts with humans, restore his health by consuming blood and revival into hell after his death. However unlike most of the Devils, certain aspects of his personality have never changed. No matter how many times he was killed, he would always come back to killing other Devils.

His first contract with Denji was that, in exchange for consuming his blood, Pochita assists him to pay his debts. It is confirmed later on as a real contract rather than the "promise" presented by a young Denji. Later on, after Denji is fatally injured by the Zombie Devil, Pochita became the heart of Denji in exchange for Denji living a "normal life."[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch82-10)

### Physical Prowess

-   **Immense Speed:** As noted by [Beam](/wiki/Beam "Beam"), the Chainsaw Devil was renowned for his amazing speed. When fighting Makima and the hybrids, he effortlessly assaulted them before they could even react. He moves almost instantly, making it look like he is teleporting to his opponents. When the [Hell Devil](/wiki/Hell_Devil "Hell Devil") was summoned to defeat Chainsaw Man, it couldn't even attack before being effortlessly dismembered.

-   **Immense Durability:** The Chainsaw Devil's body is incredibly tough, being able to survive sonic lashes, explosions, piercing attacks, massive concussive blasts capable of sending him into space, and atmospheric entry burns with little to no major repercussions. He was also able to survive the onslaught of Makima's [Thousand Year Spear](/wiki/Angel_Devil "Angel Devil") attack, even when weakened by public adoration, though he was in critical condition thereafter.

-   **Immense Strength:** As stated by Pochita himself, when he was Chainsaw Man, he was so strong that he couldn't do basic social interactions like receiving or giving a hug. This is even more highlighted on his visit to the [Burger Shop](/wiki/Family_Burger_Restaurant "Family Burger Restaurant"), where even small movements of his arms were enough to kill several locals, probably accidentally. To avoid unintentionally injuring [Kobeni](/wiki/Kobeni_Higashiyama "Kobeni Higashiyama") with his force, he had to carry her using his intestine scarf. Later, while fighting the hybrids, his attack on [Quanxi](/wiki/Quanxi "Quanxi") and the [Longsword Hybrid](/wiki/Longsword_Hybrid "Longsword Hybrid") was so powerful that it destroyed several buildings and effortlessly decapitated both of them.

-   **Immense Healing Factor**: As a full Devil, Pochita's regenerative abilities are enhanced to the point that he completely regenerated his body from just his heart after throwing it from space without needing blood, even when suffering intense atmospheric entry burns.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Ch96-11) Later on, this ability of Pochita used cleverly by Denji that he removed Pochita from his body by leaving his body without a heart and let Pochita regenerate completely to mimic Denji and fool Makima.

Chainsaw Man regenerates his body from just a heart.

### Devil Powers

-   **Devil Erasure**: The Chainsaw Devil is infamously able to consume other Devils, causing the "name" they represent to vanish from public consciousness while also erasing their physical existence. Kishibe was unable to recall historical events or things such as the Holocaust, Nazis or nuclear weapons, meaning that the Chainsaw Devil at some point consumed their respective Devils.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Ch84Pg11-12-12) The specifics of this ability are unclear; Makima was able to recall numerous erased names, and the [War Devil](/wiki/Yoru "Yoru") wanted to make the Chainsaw Devil "puke" the Nuclear Weapons Devil up. The erasure process can be partial: after the War Devil was partially devoured, the concept of "war" has remained, but no more wars have broken out in the human world.[\[13\]](#cite_note-Ch104Pg3-13)

[](/wiki/File:Chainsaw_Man_using_his_chains.png)

Chainsaw Man using his chains.

-   **Chainsaw Appendage**: As an embodiment of fear of chainsaws, protruding from Pochita's head is a chainsaw shaped appendage that functions as an actual chainsaw.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch1Pg1_-_3-1) This ability is activated when the cord in his tail is pulled. As a full Devil, besides his head, he has four arms with chainsaw appendages. He can also generate chainsaws from his legs.
    -   **Chain Entanglement**: Pochita is able to disconnect his chains from his chainsaws to wrap around his opponent's body. He uses this to pull them closer to him. He's able to capture multiple opponents with it. [Beam](/wiki/Beam "Beam") claimed that the Chainsaw Devil could use his chains to hook around buildings to move around quickly in the past, but this has yet to be seen currently.

-   **Body Assimilation**: Pochita can fuse with a human body, restoring it to full health in the process. It was done on Denji, turning him into a hybrid. It is later revealed by [Makima](/wiki/Makima "Makima") that this fusion occurred as a result of the contract. In exchange for Denji living a "normal life", Pochita becomes the heart of Denji.[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch82-10)
    -   **Devil Transformation**: Should Denji's contract with Pochita ever be broken, Pochita can possess Denji's body and return to his original form. Makima stated that he has killed her 26 times in this state. The form seems to be under the control of Pochita as it is shown that he remembers Denji's dreams and tries to fulfill the requirements of their contract by eating a hamburger and going on a date with a girl. After being defeated by Makima to save Kobeni and later being rescued by Power, Denji's contract was restored and Pochita reverted back to his heart form while Denji transformed back into his normal hybrid. Pochita still can transform into his Devil form if Denji removes the heart from his body, in this form Pochita has retain a calmer personality and has two arms similar to Denji\`s hybrid form, however his arms are still covered with an armor.

[](/wiki/File:Makita_Chainsaw_(3).jpg)

An orange-colored Makita chainsaw, which Pochita/Chainsaw Man was inspired from.

-   Pochita's dog form bears a heavy resemblance to the Makita brand of chainsaws.
    -   In fact, his name might be a play of _Pochi_ (a common dog name in japan) and the suffix "Ta" (from Makita).
-   Pochita's true form was likely inspired by the Black Gauna from the manga series [_Abara_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abara "wikipedia:Abara"), by Tsutomu Nihei. A series that [Tatsuki Fujimoto](/wiki/Tatsuki_Fujimoto "Tatsuki Fujimoto") said served as one of his inspirations for Chainsaw Man.[\[14\]](#cite_note-)

-   Angel Devil's conversation with Aki implies that all of the Public Safety Devils and Fiends (at least the ones who work as Devil Hunters) were all killed by the Chainsaw Man.

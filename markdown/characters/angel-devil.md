## Appearance

Angel resembles a young male, and is always seen wearing the Public Safety suit. He has shoulder-length hair, depicted as vermilion red in the official colored manga, with a halo floating above it and white wings on his upper back. After the events of the [International Assassins arc](/international-assassins-arc "International Assassins arc"), Angel loses both of his arms.

## Personality

The Angel Devil is a unique case among devils, having virtually no hostility towards humans.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg10-1) He considers himself to be a devil first and an angel second, stating that he believes humans ought to die in pain.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch41Pg8-2) However, he is later seen apologizing to and comforting certain humans in their deaths, suggesting some form of affection towards humans, which he suggests is a result of being part-Angel.

He dislikes being ordered around and seems to have an aversion to combat, preferring to move an unconscious enemy outside than carry on fighting.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg15-3) His extreme laziness holds him back from being a strong fighter and he often refuses to work, even claiming to prefer dying to working.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch41Pg2_-_3-4) When pressed to fight, he shows some reluctance at having to use his abilities and apologizes to the people whose life span he has stolen when he uses their life span to create weapons.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch60Pg4_-_5-5)

As a result of his power, the Angel Devil is socially withdrawn and usually is seen isolated from the rest of his fellow devil hunters, with [Aki Hayakawa](/aki-hayakawa "Aki Hayakawa") being the only one who has sort of a connection with him as he is the first known human who has not been afraid of touching him.

He is partial to soft-serve ice cream, eating three cones in one sitting and requesting another, but has shown a willingness to eat anything including zombie flesh and the corpse of a fellow devil.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch41Pg2_-_3-4)[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg10-1)[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch41Pg7-6)

He initially only wishes to die so he wouldn't have to work again, saying that he's always been prepared for the moment he dies. However, over the course of the story, Angel slowly starts to reject that notion and eventually desires to have a normal life like an ordinary human, even telling Aki that he wishes that he would quit his job as a Public Safety Devil Hunter and find another job that would allow him live a long and peaceful life. He also grows to care about his partner, becoming concerned when [Makima](/makima "Makima") forces him to make a contract with her and attempts to protect him from her.

## History

The Angel Devil's last memory was supposedly on a coast village where he found a community of people who took him in and looked after him, even if he was a Devil.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch74Pg15-7) In that community, he supposedly dated a young woman who he described as "The one I loved, and the one who loved me".[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch74Pg16-8)

Afterwards the community and his supposed girlfriend went to the beach, when suddenly [Makima](/makima "Makima") arrived, asking to see his devil powers. Though he refused at first, she insisted, ordering him to use them. He then reawoke hours later, having absorbed the lives of everyone in the village.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Ch74Pg17-9)[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch74Pg18-10)[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch74Pg18-10)[\[11\]](#cite_note-Ch74Pg19-11)

In [Chapter 74](/chapter-74 "Chapter 74"), he suddenly remembers his past after [Makima](/makima "Makima") commands [Aki](/aki-hayakawa "Aki Hayakawa") to accept a contract. Intending to fight Makima, he uses 10 years of life force to create a blade. However, she merely says the word "Down" and the Angel Devil crumples to the floor. She kneels next to him, ordering him to give his all to her. Possessed by the power of mental control, Angel Devil agrees to being [Makima](/makima "Makima")´s dog and obey her orders.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Ch75Pg2-12)[\[13\]](#cite_note-Ch75Pg3-13)[\[14\]](#cite_note-Ch75Pg4-14)[\[15\]](#cite_note-Ch75Pg5-15)

## Abilities

As a Devil, the Angel Devil possesses all of the standard [devil abilities](/devil#general-abilities "Devil"). Besides standard abilities, the Angel Devil possess unique ability to absorb life-spans with a simple touch, which makes him really strong. The Angel Devil is considered to be Division 4's second-strongest agent after Captain [Kishibe](/kishibe "Kishibe") but his laziness holds him back.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Ch41Pg4-16)

### Physical Prowess

-   **Enhanced Reflexes**: Angel has superhuman reflexes, being fast enough to block bullets with his wings and keep up with Quanxi's immense speed.

### Supernatural Abilities

-   **Angelic Wings**: The Angel Devil has the ability to extend angel like wings from its back. These wings are tough enough to deflect gunfire and can be used as impromptu shields, however bullets are still powerful enough to cause him pain.[\[17\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg14-17) It is unknown if he can fly, similar to the [Bat Devil](/bat-devil "Bat Devil").

    [](/file:makima-attacks-kobeni.png)
    
    "Usage: 1,000 Years" is used by Makima against the Chainsaw Man.
    

-   **Life-Span Absorption**: The Angel Devil can absorb the life spans of humans through physical contact.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg10-1) This will eventually kill the affected one painlessly if they touch long enough.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch41Pg8-2) After Aki briefly grabbed his hand, the Angel Devil estimated that Aki had lost two months of his life span.[\[18\]](#cite_note-Ch50Pg11-18)
-   **Life-Span Weapons**: The Angel Devil can transform the siphoned life spans into weapons that have supernatural properties through his halo such as Aki's katana which can cut through the normally intangible [Ghost Devil](/ghost-devil "Ghost Devil").[\[19\]](#cite_note-Ch41Pg5-19) Due to his nightmares about the people who he siphoned their life spans, he is hesitant to use this ability frequently.
    -   **Usage: Five Years** (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>五</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ご</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>年</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ねん</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>使</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>し</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>用</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>よう</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _Gonen Shiyō_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")): By using up five years worth of collected life span, the Angel Devil can manifest a sword from his halo which can seemingly instantly kill anyone that he cuts with it without leaving a mark.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch60Pg4_-_5-5)
    -   **Usage: Ten Years** (10<ruby lang="ja"><rb>年</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ねん</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>使</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>し</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>用</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>よう</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _Jūnen Shiyō_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")): By using up ten years worth of collected life span, the Angel Devil can manifest a sword from his halo. Its effect and strength remain unknown because it was used against Makima and she quickly knocked him down before he attacks.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Ch75Pg2-12)
    -   **Usage: 100 Years** (100<ruby lang="ja"><rb>年</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ねん</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>使</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>し</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>用</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>よう</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _Hyakunen Shiyō_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")): By using up a hundred years worth of collected life span, the Angel Devil can manifest a sword from his halo. This ability is used by [Makima](/makima "Makima") against [Power](/power "Power") while she is controlling the Angel Devil.
    -   **Usage: 1,000 Years** (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>千</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>せん</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>年</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ねん</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>使</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>し</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>用</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>よう</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _Sennen Shiyō_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")): By using up thousand years worth of collected life span, the Angel Devil can manifest a spear from his halo. This ability is used by [Makima](/makima "Makima") against the [Chainsaw Man](/denji "Denji") while she is controlling the Angel Devil. Makima threw this spear by summoning three humanoid entities. This technique is strong enough to defeat the Chainsaw Devil.

### Skillset

-   **Spear Proficiency**: The Angel Devil is skilled at using spears in combat; accurately throwing a spear through Reze from a nearby rooftop.[\[20\]](#cite_note-Ch52Pg10_-_11-20)
-   **Swordsmanship**: The Angel Devil can use a sword with some skill, cutting down five of Santa Claus' puppets in a single swing.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch60Pg4_-_5-5)

## Trivia

-   Angel Devil's appearance is based on the lowest classifications of angels, simply called angels. They are the most commonly depicted angels in classic paintings from the medieval and renaissance times. The other Angels on the lowest order of the angelic hierarchy are Archangels and Principalities.
    -   Contrary to popular belief, humanoid angels are also biblically accurate and an angel's appearance depends on their ranking in the celestial hierarchy. It would make sense for Angel Devil to be humanoid because, aside from being friendlier, it is the ranking of angels whose appearances have been the most known amongst all angels, even if in actuality angels are diverse. It is also not impossible for Angel Devil to take on the appearance of different angel rankings in different lives either.
    -   Angel's appearance might be based on Lucifer, who is depicted with auburn hair in the painting "_The Fallen Angel"_ by Alexandre Cabanel. Lucifer is often described as beautiful, just as Angel is depicted as attractive, so much that [Denji](/denji "Denji") briefly considered him a potential partner before dropping the idea since Angel is male.
-   It is possible that Angel's ability to steal and weaponize life span could be because sometimes angels are symbolic of or associated with death, dead beings, or seen when dying.
-   He is one of the followers of Chainsaw Man. Other followers of Chainsaw Man were [Power](/power "Power"), [Beam](/beam "Beam"), [Galgali](/galgali "Galgali"), [Princi](/princi "Princi"), **Seraphim**, **Dominion** and **Virtue**.
-   Angel Devil's rankings in the [Popularity Polls](/popularity-polls "Popularity Polls") are as follows:
    -   Angel ranked 6th in the First Popularity Poll with 13,374 votes.
    -   Angel ranked 7th in the Second Popularity Poll with 27,761 votes.
-   Angel Devil's death has long been the subject of debate among the fandom, as it was never fully depicted or pictured in the manga. It was later confirmed in an interview with Tatsuki Fujimoto that he had indeed passed away.[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)
    -   This was also the result of Fujimoto letting his editor, Shihei Lin, decide who should die between [Kobeni](/kobeni-higashiyama "Kobeni Higashiyama") and Angel Devil. Lin had picked Kobeni to die, as he did not want Angel to suffer that fate. Fujimoto then assumed that if the readers did not want Angel to die, then he should perhaps truly kill him off.

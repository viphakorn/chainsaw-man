## Plot

### [International Assassins arc](/international-assassins-arc "International Assassins arc")

In Hell, Quanxi gets decapitated and Long and Pingsti are killed. However when transported back, Tsugihagi manages to obtain Quanxi's head and when looking back she realises that Long and Pingsti have been killed. She stands at the top of the building that had been sent to hell and pulls out an arrow from under Quanxi's eyepatch. She then drops Quanxi's head to the fight that was occurring between Denji and Santa Claus below, allowing Quanxi to transform into her hybrid form and kill the dolls that were attacking Denji.

After Santa Claus has been dealt with. Makima appears out from the smoke, drawing her sword. Quanxi surrenders, pleading to Makima to not kill her women, even offering her own limbs so that she won't. However, her words are futile, and Makima kills Quanxi, Cosmo and Tsugihagi by decapitating them.

## Abilities

As a [Fiend](/fiend "Fiend"), Tsugihagi can't make [contracts](/contract "Contract") and her powers are considerably weaker than those of her devil form. Tsugihagi abilities are currently unknown, but she still has all the other standard [devil abilities](/devil#general-abilities "Devil").

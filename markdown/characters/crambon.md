**Crambon** (クランボン, _Kuranbon_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")) was a cat who was saved and adopted by [Asa Mitaka](/asa-mitaka "Asa Mitaka"), during the attack of the [Typhoon Devil](/typhoon-devil "Typhoon Devil").

## History

During the attack of the Typhoon Devil, Crambon hurt it's paw. Seeing this Asa tried saving it but tripped and fell. Because of this [Asa's Mother](/asa-mitaka%27s-mother "Asa Mitaka's Mother") had to stop and help her up which cost her her own life.

After the attack, having no family left Asa adopted the cat and named it Crambon. Together with Asa he was moved to an orphanage for children whose families have been killed by devils.

There, her [caretaker](/asa-mitaka%27s-caretaker "Asa Mitaka's caretaker"), whose mother also (allegedly) died because of the Typhoon Devil, convinced her to give Crambon away to give him a happier home. However, another orphan later told Asa that the children found Crambon drowned in a river. It turned out that the caretaker had lied to Asa and killed Crambon because she was jealous that Asa still had someone she considered family.

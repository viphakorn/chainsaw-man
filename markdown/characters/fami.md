## Appearance

Fami takes on the appearance of a young woman who wears a high school uniform and a black cap from the Devil Hunter Club. She is tall, has grayish [mountbatten pink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountbatten_pink) colored neck-length hair, and has several moles on her face. Similar to the other Horsemen, she has piercing, multiple-ringed eyes. On a colored manga cover her eyes are shown to be pink. Her ears feature four earrings, two of which are beads on her right and the other two are unusually long and have a triangular shape at the end.

## Personality

Fami has a very mysterious personality, and her face shows little emotion. She is always calm, cold, and composed and also seems to be very good at reading others, as she accurately describes both [Asa](/wiki/Asa_Mitaka "Asa Mitaka")'s and [Denji](/wiki/Denji "Denji")'s characters. However, her knowledge is limited, since she doesn't seem to know that Denji is Chainsaw Man. Fami doesn't care if someone discovers her true identity and therefore puts little to no effort into her alias. What's more is that she doesn't necessarily seem to be as outwardly malicious as her brethren, even informing Public Safety officials such as Yoshida about more dangerous Devils, albeit after being threatened first. Despite being intelligent, she underestimates people, believing that Asa, like most people, would be willing to do anything to survive if forced to, which gets proven wrong.

While she doesn't hesitate to try to force Asa to murder Denji and turn him into [Yoru](/wiki/Yoru "Yoru")'s weapon, she is very polite to her. Fami also seems affectionate towards Yoru, saying that she would do anything for her "little sister." Despite Fami's affection for Yoru, the War Devil does not reciprocate those feelings and describes her as insane and someone Asa should stay away from. As shown, it's been implied that Fami has a similar relationship with the other [Four Horsemen](/wiki/Four_Horsemen "Four Horsemen"), as seen where the current [Control Devil](/wiki/Nayuta "Nayuta") called her sister.

Befitting her status as the Famine Devil, Fami is also a major glutton, frequently ordering inhuman levels of food to consume in a single setting. She wants to prevent the extinction of humanity and the resulting age of Devils, since that would also mean the end of her favorite foods, something she describes as "the worst scenario imaginable."

## Abilities

As a Devil, Fami possesses all of the standard [Devil abilities](/wiki/Devil#General_Abilities "Devil"). While her powers and their extent are still unclear, she seems to be able to influence the power of Devils in some way. She was able to temporarily separate Yoru from Asa, leaving Asa, her power to turn people and objects into weapons and communicate with her at a distance despite her being trapped in another Devil's pocket dimension.

### Supernatural Abilities

-   **Enhancing Healing**: Fami has shown the ability to heal others, causing the healed person to gain great strength and size. This ability was used on Yuko after she was fatally injured by Asa Mitaka's weapon. [\[1\]](#cite_note-1)

-   **Enslavement**: As Fami embodies the fear of famine or starvation, her abilities reflects this nature. She's able to turn any being experiencing hunger/starvation into her pawn to do her bidding. This ability works even on Primal Fears. Furthermore she can turn those whom she put under her control into miniature figurines of themselves to transport them easily.
    -   **[Falling Devil](/wiki/Falling_Devil "Falling Devil"):** As shown, one of the devils that she has successfully enslaved into becoming her subordinate is the Primal Fear, Falling Devil. As shown, Fami possess a powerful control over this devil despite her immense power, as shown where she obediently follows her orders without question.

## Trivia

-   Fami's name is written entirely in katakana (キガ), showcasing no semantic meanings. However, her name is a play on the number of syllables of the word famine to the amount of [mora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora_(linguistics) "wikipedia:Mora (linguistics)") the Hepburn romanization "kiga" has.
-   The name "Fami," is only in the English translation of the manga. The Spanish, French, and Portuguese translations use the name "Kiga."
-   Fami's earrings are a reference to the Horseman of Famine's depiction in the Book of Revelation, where he is depicted holding scales for weighing food. Famine is also sometimes interpreted as the "Lord as a Law-Giver."
    -   Both Famine and Justice are often represented by scales.
    -   Fami's head is nearly always tilted to her left (like an unbalanced scale)
-   Like with [Santa Claus](/wiki/Santa_Claus "Santa Claus"), Fujimoto likely gave Fami numeral facial moles because he finds that the more moles a character has, the better they look.
-   In Japanese the word "kiga" has the same homophone as the Japanese word for "penguin." So, in the Japanese language, there was meant to be a double comedic effect of how Denji wanted to see penguins and Kiga appears shortly after.

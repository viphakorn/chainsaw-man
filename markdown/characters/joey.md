## Appearance

Joey is a tall man of average build, with long disheveled hair, and sinister eyes. He wears a suit similar to the Public Safety Devil Hunter uniform.

## Personality

Joey is the middle sibling but appears to be the least mature out of his siblings to the point that he is described as a dumbass by his older brother. He is also a womanizer, being after women no matter what country he is in. He enjoys smoking.

Despite his crude personality, he is still very close to his family, he reacted in shock and was angered by his brother dying, and tried to calm himself and Aldo before his death.

## Plot

### [International Assassins arc](/wiki/International_Assassins_arc "International Assassins arc")

In New York, U.S.A. Joey and his brothers eat at their home. The elder brother tells his brothers about a job he received from federal agents, which involves hunting a person. Joey asks if they will be hunting women, saying that Japan is all about women. The elder brother shows them [Chainsaw Man](/wiki/Denji "Denji") on their television and says they will be paid $2 million if they kill the man. The younger brother, [Aldo](/wiki/Aldo "Aldo"), expresses fear of dying, but his brothers talk him down, reminding him that they survived many things, even the Gun Devil's onslaught. As they prepare to leave for Japan, the elder brother refers to themselves as "immortal."[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch53Pg17_-_21-1)

After arriving in Japan, the brothers ambush three Devil Hunters on their way to Tokyo. They throw a set of road spikes in front of the vehicle, causing it to swerve and crash into a tree. Outside the wreckage, the brothers shoot the Hunters dead. Joey looks inside and sees [Tendo](/wiki/Michiko_Tendo "Michiko Tendo"), whom he says was a shame to kill, seeing how fine she was. The elder two brothers crack jokes, however, Aldo reacts with horror to the killing.

Hiding the bodies, Aldo vomits. The elder brother asks Joey his feelings on killing, with Joey stating his only response to be mild annoyance and disgust. The elder brother laughs, before changing his face to match [Kurose](/wiki/Yutaro_Kurose "Yutaro Kurose")'s. The three then discuss Kurose's voice, as the elder brother shifts his tone and accent to match it.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch55Pg10_-_19-2)

The brothers get to Tokyo, where Joey and Aldo disguise themselves as civilians, while the disguised elder brother talks with [Special Division 4](/wiki/Tokyo_Special_Division_4 "Tokyo Special Division 4"). As the elder brother and Denji talk, they are suddenly rammed by [Kobeni](/wiki/Kobeni_Higashiyama "Kobeni Higashiyama")'s [car](/wiki/Kobeni%27s_car "Kobeni's car"), driven by [Power](/wiki/Power "Power"). While everyone tries to process the situation, the elder brother's disguise slips away, revealing his true face.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch57Pg5_-_12-3) Watching from the side, Joey and Aldo watch in terror.

The brothers move to an alleyway, where they remove their disguises. Aldo vomits and Joey attempts to collect himself, then vows to kill the fiend. However, he gets suddenly pulled around the corner by [Yoshida](/wiki/Hirofumi_Yoshida "Hirofumi Yoshida") and is wounded. Yoshida walks around the corner to talk with a disguised Aldo for a brief moment, before returning behind the corner to execute Joey.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch57Pg15_-_19-4)

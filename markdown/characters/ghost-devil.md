## Appearance

The Ghost Devil is a large devil with a somewhat cylindrical body; its torso is covered in white flowers with either yellow or pink centers and has several arms instead of legs. In the colored manga it seems to have skin (arms and legs) of a grey hue but change in tint depending on the scene. It's head appears old and desiccated, with long dark wavy or curly hair and sunken cheeks. The Ghost Devil's eyes and mouth are sewn shut.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch25Pg6-1) In the anime the flowers are pink on the outside and blue on the inside.

## Personality

The Ghost Devil's personality is largely unknown except that it initially refused to fight against [Katana Man](/katana-man "Katana Man") because it considered [Akane Sawatari](/akane-sawatari "Akane Sawatari") to be scary, but after [Himeno](/himeno "Himeno") offered up her entire body as payment to the Ghost Devil, it quickly changed its mind and showed excitement.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch25Pg3_-_5-2) During Aki's final confrontation with the Ghost Devil, it is shown to harbor residual sentiment for its previous contract, Himeno, as it carried Aki's first cigarettes with it for years until Aki was ready.

## Plot

### History

At some point, the Ghost Devil formed a contract with [Himeno](/himeno "Himeno") allowing her to control its right hand in exchange for consuming her right eye.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch15Pg5-3)

### [Eternity Devil arc](/eternity-devil-arc "Eternity Devil arc")

![Himeno using Ghost Devil against Eternity Devil](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/chainsaw-man/images/b/b4/Himeno_using_Ghost_Devil_against_Eternity_Devil.png "Himeno using Ghost Devil against Eternity Devil.png")

[](/file:himeno-using-ghost-devil-against-eternity-devil.png)

Himeno using Ghost Devil against Eternity Devil

[Himeno](/himeno "Himeno") uses an arm of the Ghost Devil to grab the [Eternity Devil](/eternity-devil "Eternity Devil") in midair so that [Power](/power "Power") can slice it to pieces. She explains that she has a contract with the Ghost Devil and reveals the nature of their contract.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch15Pg3_-_5-4) When Power decides to test Himeno and threatens [Kobeni Higashiyama](/kobeni-higashiyama "Kobeni Higashiyama"), Himeno uses the Ghost Devil's arm to choke Power into submission. Power cannot touch the Ghost Devil's arm and Himeno relents after Power surrenders.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch15Pg7-5)

After the Eternity Devil has trapped the group in the hotel and has increased in size, Himeno tries using the arm of the Ghost Devil to finish it off by gouging out chunks of its body but is unsuccessful.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch17Pg3_-_4-6)

When [Aki Hayakawa](/aki-hayakawa "Aki Hayakawa") suggests using his sword to defeat the Eternity Devil, Himeno restrains him with the Ghost Devil's arm.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch18Pg1_-_2-7)

As [Denji](/denji "Denji") battles the Eternity Devil in his transformed state, he is nearly defeated, but Himeno intervenes and uses the Ghost Devil's arm to pull Denji's cord which causes him to regenerate.[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch19Pg12_-_13-8)

### [Katana Man arc](/katana-man-arc "Katana Man arc")

Ghost Devil appears

After [Aki Hayakawa](/aki-hayakawa "Aki Hayakawa") is slashed by the [Katana Man](/katana-man "Katana Man"), Himeno asks for the Ghost Devil's assistance, but it refuses as it considers [Akane Sawatari](/akane-sawatari "Akane Sawatari") to be too scary. Himeno responds by offering up her entire body to the Ghost Devil in exchange for all of it's power, to which the Ghost Devil smiles eagerly and agrees to the deal.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch25Pg3_-_5-2) Himeno summons the full body of the Ghost Devil and uses it to overwhelm the Katana Man until he calls for Akane's help. Akane summons the [Snake Devil](/snake-devil "Snake Devil") to swallow the Ghost Devil, seemingly decapitating it while Himeno's body vanishes.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Ch25Pg6_-_13-9)

At a later date, during the raid on the terrorist's hideout, Aki comes across Akane and he orders her to surrender, but instead she commands the Snake Devil to spit out the Ghost Devil which is now subservient to her.[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch34Pg16_-_19-10)

The Ghost Devil attempts to strike Aki with its many arms, but he uses the future sight gained from the [Future Devil](/future-devil "Future Devil") to evade its attacks and cut off several of its arms.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Ch35Pg1_-_3-11) Aki is quickly overwhelmed by the number of attacks and is eventually caught by the Ghost Devil who begins squeezing the life from him at Akane's command.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Ch35Pg4_-_7-12) Before it can finish killing him, the Ghost Devil drops Aki to the ground and offers him a cigarette with the words "Easy revenge!" written on it.[\[13\]](#cite_note-Ch35Pg9_-_12-13) Remembering a conversation he had with Himeno where she told him that the Ghost Devil can only sense through fear, Aki stops feeling afraid and climbs the Ghost Devil's body. He decapitates it with a blow from his sword, killing the Ghost Devil.[\[14\]](#cite_note-Ch35Pg13_-_17-14)

## Abilities

![Ghost Devil attacks with her hands](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/chainsaw-man/images/a/a3/Ghost_Devil_attacks_with_her_hands.png "Ghost Devil attacks with her hands.png")

[](/file:ghost-devil-attacks-with-her-hands.png)

Ghost Devil attacks with its hands

As a Devil, the Ghost Devil possesses all of the standard [devil abilities](/devil#general-abilities "Devil"), such the ability to make contracts with humans for a price.

The only known contract is the one with [Himeno](/himeno "Himeno"); in exchange for her right eye, Himeno can use the power of the Ghost Devil's right arm which stays with her at all times.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch15Pg3_-_5-4) The Ghost Devil can communicate with Himeno through its right arm by forming a mouth. Later on, by sacrificing more of her body, Himeno can use the full power of the Ghost Devil's entire body for a brief period of time.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch25Pg3_-_5-2)

### Physical Abilities

-   **Enhanced Strength**: The Ghost Devil has a great deal of physical strength; with just one of its numerous limbs it could hit [Aki Hayakawa](/aki-hayakawa "Aki Hayakawa") hard enough to make him drop his sword and lift him into the air by his neck to choke him.[\[15\]](#cite_note-Ch35Pg4_-_5-15)

### Devil Powers

-   **Ghost Physiology**: As the embodiment of the fear of ghosts, the Ghost Devil has a body similar to ghosts. Its body is selectively intangible, preventing it from being touched by others, however special weapons can cut it [\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch15Pg7-5)[\[16\]](#cite_note-Ch41Pg5-16) and other devils can attack it. It can also become invisible as [Himeno](/himeno "Himeno") could use its right arm to invisibly grab the Eternity Devil without anyone seeing it.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch15Pg3_-_5-4)

-   **Fear Perception**: The Ghost Devil has no eyes as it perceives through fear instead; however this can backfire on it as it cannot sense someone approaching who feels no fear.[\[17\]](#cite_note-Ch35Pg13_-_15-17)

### Weaknesses

-   **Near Lack of Senses**: As mentioned above, the Ghost Devil can perceive through fear, but it seems to lack several other senses. It is unknown how many senses it lacks in total but sight is one primary sense it lacks.

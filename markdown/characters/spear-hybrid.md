Hybrid Form

## Personality

The Spear Hybrid's real personality is currently unknown, as he was brainwashed and mind-controlled by Makima. His few lines show him as a competitive individual, proposing to his allies that whoever kills Chainsaw Man first earns the right to ask Makima out on a date.

## Plot

### [Control Devil arc](/control-devil-arc "Control Devil arc")

At an unknown point in time, the Spear Hybrid was brainwashed by Makima to serve her needs. He is summoned as part of Makima's newly-formed [Special Division 5](/tokyo-special-division-5 "Tokyo Special Division 5"), a team of weapon hybrids created for the sole purpose of battling the fully-powered [Chainsaw Devil](/chainsaw-devil "Chainsaw Devil").[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch86Pg14-15-1) While under Makima's control, the Spear Hybrid suggests turning their first operation into a competition, to see who earns the right to ask Makima on a date.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch86Pg16-2)

Once Makima commands Special Division 5 to attack, each member activates their weapon trigger, transforming into their Hybrid forms. They all leap from their respective spots to lunge straight towards Chainsaw Man. Before any of the Hybrids can land a single blow on him, they are all blown back by Chainsaw Man leaping forward from the building he stood on to initiate the fight.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch87Pg4-9-3)

Shortly after Chainsaw Man decapitates [Reze](/reze "Reze"), who lifted him into the sky, the Spear Hybrid took advantage of this by hurling one of his spears straight at the opponent's chest. He is eventually torn to shreds alongside the remaining Special Division 5 members after Chainsaw Man withstands their combined attack of sending him into space.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch88Pg6-17-4)

At some point in the future, Special Division 5's Hybrids are revived once more by Makima, who brings them all to a graveyard to confront Denji.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch93Pg12-13-5) Once Makima finishes monologuing her thoughts of erasing anything she dislikes to Pochita (who is disguised as Denji), the Spear Hybrid and the other Weapon Humans transform into their Hybrid forms for the final battle.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch93Pg18-19-6)

During this confrontation, he impales Pochita from behind after he takes down [Katana Man](/katana-man "Katana Man") and the [Longsword Hybrid](/longsword-hybrid "Longsword Hybrid"). Reze and the [Whip Hybrid](/whip-hybrid "Whip Hybrid") attempt to follow up by attacking on both sides. However, Pochita retaliates by using a spinning aerial slash to take down the three Hybrids, who all fall to the ground defeated.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch94Pg7-9-7)

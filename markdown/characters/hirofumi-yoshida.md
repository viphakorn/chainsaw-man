**Hirofumi Yoshida** (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>吉</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>よし</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>田</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>だ</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> ヒロフミ, _Yoshida Hirofumi_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")) is a [Public Safety Devil Hunter](/devil-hunter "Devil Hunter") and formerly a private Devil Hunter. Together with [Kusakabe](/kusakabe "Kusakabe") and [Tamaoki](/tamaoki "Tamaoki"), he is considered by [Makima](/makima "Makima") as a high-class bodyguard specialist. He is also a member of [an organization](/hirofumi-yoshida%27s-organization "Hirofumi Yoshida's organization") that tasked him with keeping Denji safe.

Yoshida first appears as a supporting character in the [International Assassins arc](/international-assassins-arc "International Assassins arc") and has a larger recurring role in the [Academy Saga](/academy-saga "Academy Saga").

## Appearance

Yoshida has mid-length smooth black hair, dark eyes, and a slim face. There is a beauty mark under his lips. He has eight piercings on his left ear, though usually, only six are visible below his hair.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch62Pg13-1) His piercings are likely a reference to his contract with the [Octopus Devil](/octopus-devil "Octopus Devil"). As a civilian Devil Hunter, Yoshida wears a casual outfit that consists of an unbuttoned light jacket and dark pants.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch62Pg11-2)

## Personality

Yoshida is quite playful and mischievous and loves to have small talk with his opponents during battle. Although Yoshida always has a smile on his face, he is also ruthless. This side of him is demonstrated when he mercilessly kills the [Joey](/joey "Joey") of the three Immortal Brothers in a back alley after showing up behind the surviving brother.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch57Pg17_-_19-3) From his interactions with [Kishibe](/kishibe "Kishibe"), he is revealed to be still attending high school.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch67Pg5-4)

Yoshida seems to take his job seriously; he told Denji that if he attempts to reveal his identity as Chainsaw Man, he will interfere and take action to stop him, and eventually does it by grabbing him with the power of the [Octopus Devil](/octopus-devil "Octopus Devil") right before [Yoru](/yoru "Yoru") could attack him in his back, demonstrating he is also someone who keeps his word.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch110Pg3-5-5)

He also seems to have a disdain for death, asking if it is possible for Denji, as Chainsaw Man, to consume the Death Devil for the good of the people. Whether this is a personal desire or the intentions of the organization he is part of is currently unknown. He even remarks by mocking the Eternity Devil that trapped him with his fellow members of the Devil Hunter Club that, thanks to its existence, he now appreciates life more in general.

Yoshida is someone who doesn't like to beat around the bush and prefers to get straight to the point, as seen when he meets [Fami](/fami "Fami") and immediately asks her about her next moves, even threatening her if she doesn't cooperate with him and Public Safety.

## Abilities

### Devil Contracts

![Octopus Devil Arm](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/chainsaw-man/images/5/58/Octopus_Devil_Arm.png "Octopus Devil Arm.png")

[](/file:octopus-devil-arm.png)

-   **Octopus Devil Contract**: Yoshida has a contract with the [Octopus Devil](/octopus-devil "Octopus Devil") for an unknown price.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch61Pg8-6)
    -   **Tentacle Summoning**: By crossing his middle and index fingers, he can summon the Octopus Devil's tentacles which protrude from ink clouds. He can summon multiple of these to attack small groups or bind them. Yoshida can summon them to wrap himself for protection or use them to catch him from falling to his death.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch61Pg9-7)
        -   **Ink**: By saying "Ink," the tentacle will produce a large black smokescreen. Yoshida uses this to blind his opponents and attack.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch61Pg9-7)

### Skillset

-   **Hand-to-Hand Combatant**: During his brief fight with [Quanxi](/quanxi "Quanxi"), he has shown quite a remarkable level of abilities in hand-to-hand combat, fighting for a few minutes on equal terms with her, someone who is well-known for her unnatural physical strength and fighting prowess, although he loses the battle.[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch62Pg11_-_15-8)

## Etymology

-   Hirofumi's surname **Yoshida** means "lucky, good" (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>吉</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>よし</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _**yoshi**_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")) and "field, rice paddy" (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>田</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>た・だ</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _**ta**/**da**_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")). It is also the 11th most common Japanese surname.

## Trivia

-   Hirofumi's rankings in the [Popularity Polls](/popularity-polls "Popularity Polls") are as follows:
    -   Hirofumi ranked 10th in the First Popularity Poll with 8,593 votes.
    -   Hirofumi ranked 6th in the Second Popularity Poll with 32,161 votes.
-   Tatsuki Fujimoto has admitted to being puzzled about Hirofumi's popularity. He had expected him to rank much lower relative to what the actual results ended up being. It only came to light when his assistant told him about it.[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)
    -   Shihei Lin comically received a comment from a fan asking for Yoshida not to be too active in the manga, as that would make him die faster.
-   Hirofumi was the first character _other than Denji_ confirmed to make an appearance in Part 2, even before [Asa Mitaka](/asa-mitaka "Asa Mitaka").[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)
-   In Chapter 114, he is referred to as a Public Safety Devil Hunter, making it unknown whether he is truly a private Devil Hunter.
-   So far, there have been two instances of Yoshida inviting someone for dinner to talk with them, and that generosity getting exploited by the second party.

## Appearance

### Full Devil Form (November 18th Attack-100%)

While never pictured in the manga, it has been stated that when the full form (100%) of the Gun Devil first appeared in the attacks of November 18th, it was depicted as having a full set of legs, feet, bones and flesh as well.[\[1\]](#cite_note-:0-1) Not much else is known about its full figure, however.

### Fragmented Devil Form (American percentage-20%)

When 20% of its body is summoned by the President of the [United States](/wiki/World#United_States_of_America "World"), the Gun Devil resembles an enormous floating humanoid figure with multiple building-sized rifles for arms, a roughly skeletal body crammed full of disembodied screaming heads, and an oversized barrel and slide emerging from its skull-like face. The Gun Devil is also missing the lower half of its body and is instead replaced by 6 long giant [7.62×51mm NATO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.62%C3%9751mm_NATO "wikipedia:7.62×51mm NATO") ammo belts attached to the bottom of its torso.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch75Pg16_-_17-2)

The main parts of both its arms appear to be [M4 Carbines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_carbine "wikipedia:M4 carbine"), with other well-known assault rifles in its arms well. These include: the [AK-47](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-47 "wikipedia:AK-47") , the [M16A1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M16_rifle "wikipedia:M16 rifle"), and the [Mk18 assault rifle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Quarters_Battle_Receiver "wikipedia:Close Quarters Battle Receiver"). Both arms appear to wield the same rifles. The Gun Devil's head appears to be the slide and barrel of a large [M1911](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1911_pistol "wikipedia:M1911 pistol") missing the hammer. Some of the firearms on its back appear to be unknown Infantry Rifles, all others are completely unidentifiable.

### Fiend Form (Aki Hayakawa)

After the Gun Devil took over [Aki Hayakawa](/wiki/Aki_Hayakawa "Aki Hayakawa")'s body and becomes the Gun Fiend, its hair is let down with its eyes and forehead covered in dark veins. The barrel and slide of an M1911 is seen protruding out of its face in between its eyes with the gun's hammer sticking out the back of its head, its left forearm is replaced with an M4.

Fiend Form (Aki Hayakawa)

## Personality

Not much is known about the Gun Devil but it is stated that he is the devil obsessed with obtaining Denji's heart and sent his followers to finish the job while also seemingly ordering the massacre towards the Devil Hunter. However, by the time it makes his appearance, it was revealed to be nothing but a force of nature who becomes a former shell of himself and ended up being tied in a contract with the American President in order to defeat the real evil that has plaguing the world in the history of mankind, [Makima](/wiki/Makima "Makima"). And to that end, the Gun Devil ended up having no choice but commit a huge massacre in order to defeat Makima once and for all. By the time he possessed Aki, the latter then ended up having his mind becoming warped and was reduced into a former shell of himself, reminiscing about his childhood that he desperately wants to come back into to no avail as his family was killed during the massacre of the Gun Devil.

## Plot

### History

Thirteen years before the present day, the whole world tried to cash in on guns as a countermeasure against devils. This led to an increase in gun use during crimes and civil revolts. Due to heavy media coverage of gun crimes in every country, worldwide fear of guns has increased drastically.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch13Pg2-3)

[![Gun Devils Destruction](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/chainsaw-man/images/6/6f/Gun_Devils_Destruction.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220806080942)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/chainsaw-man/images/6/6f/Gun_Devils_Destruction.png/revision/latest?cb=20220806080942)

[](/wiki/File:Gun_Devils_Destruction.png)

The Gun Devil's Destruction

On November 18th a large terrorist attack involving guns occurred in America, causing that to be the day that the Gun Devil first appeared.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch13Pg2_-_3-4) The Gun Devil hit Japan for 26 seconds, killing 57,912 people. [Aki Hayakawa](/wiki/Aki_Hayakawa "Aki Hayakawa") witnessed the Gun Devil destroying his house and killing his family as it passed by.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch13Pg9_-_12-5) It hit several countries around the world in succession eventually leading a death toll of 1.2 million lives in only five minutes.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch13Pg2_-_3-4) [Aldo](/wiki/Aldo "Aldo"), [Joey](/wiki/Joey "Joey"), and their brother survived the Gun Devil's attack but lost their home along with their father, mother and grandmother. This would be one of the events in their lives that would lead them to believe that they're immortal.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch53Pg20_-_21-6)

After that, the Gun Devil disappeared but its impact on human society led to an overall increase in fear of all devils.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch13Pg13-7) An international law has been prepared to strictly control the manufacturing of arms in every country to lower the fear of guns.[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch73Pg12-8)

At some point in time, the Gun Devil has been taken down by someone unknown and he was found by the Soviet Union while he was in an unconscious state. His body is separated into several pieces and held by countries and devils. Specifically, 20% of his body is owned by the United States, 28% is owned by the Soviet Union, 11% is owned by China, 4% is owned by other nations and the remaining 37% is in the form of pieces of meat in the hands of devils scattered around the world.[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch73Pg12-8)

### [Bat Devil arc](/wiki/Bat_Devil_arc "Bat Devil arc")

Aki states that his team did not find any Gun flesh in the Leech and Bat devils.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Ep4-9)

### [Eternity Devil arc](/wiki/Eternity_Devil_arc "Eternity Devil arc")

[Makima](/wiki/Makima "Makima") asks [Denji](/wiki/Denji "Denji") for a favor; she wants him to defeat the Gun Devil whose location is currently unknown. She offers to grant any one wish he has if he can kill it.[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch12Pg16_-_19-10)

Makima explains the history of the Gun Devil to Denji and explains that they're currently trying to track it using pieces of the Gun Devil's flesh.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Ch13Pg13_-_15-11) Meanwhile Aki and [Himeno](/wiki/Himeno "Himeno") take down a devil and recover a chunk of the Gun Devil's flesh from it. The pull of the Gun Devil's flesh leads them to Morino Hotel where they dispatch a six-man team to investigate.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Ch13Pg16_-_19-12)

A piece of the Gun Devil's body is recovered by Aki from the [Eternity Devil](/wiki/Eternity_Devil "Eternity Devil")'s corpse.[\[13\]](#cite_note-Ch20Pg5-13) Later at a party Aki comments that devils with Gun Devil pieces are becoming more common.[\[14\]](#cite_note-Ch21Pg2-14)

### [Katana Man arc](/wiki/Katana_Man_arc "Katana Man arc")

The Katana Man confronts [Denji](/wiki/Denji "Denji"), Aki, Himeno and [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") in a restaurant and relates a story to them about his grandfather. As he finishes up, he tells Denji that the Gun Devil wants his heart and opens fire, wounding Denji, Aki and Himeno.[\[15\]](#cite_note-Ch23Pg10_-_14-15) Simultaneously most of the members of the Special Divisions elsewhere are assassinated.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Ch23Pg4_-_9-16)

After learning from [Madoka](/wiki/Madoka "Madoka") that most of the humans in Special Divisions 1, 2, 3 and 4 have been killed in coordinated gun attacks, Makima states that it is likely the Gun Devil is involved.[\[17\]](#cite_note-Ch28Pg15-17) However, Makima later claims that these guns are manufactured by humans secretly despite the international law.[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch73Pg12-8)

### [Bomb Girl arc](/wiki/Bomb_Girl_arc "Bomb Girl arc")

Beam tells Aki that the [Bomb Devil](/wiki/Bomb_Devil "Bomb Devil") is the ally of the Gun Devil. When pressed on how he knows this [Beam](/wiki/Beam "Beam") claims that if he reveals this information that he will be killed and that he promised Makima to keep it secret.[\[18\]](#cite_note-Ch41Pg14_-_15-18)

### [Gun Devil arc](/wiki/Gun_Devil_arc "Gun Devil arc")

Makima reveals that the Gun Devil is already defeated and its separated pieces are held by various countries.

The President of the United States then contracts with 20% of the Gun Devil in the hands of the United States to kill [Makima](/wiki/Makima "Makima") in exchange for a one-year lifespan of every citizen of the United States. On September 12, 1997 the Gun Devil hits the city of Nikaho in Akita Prefecture, Japan from off the coast for 12 seconds. Immediately upon his appearance, he activates his ability to fire bullets. The Gun Devil advances toward Makima while killing the people and destroying the cities he passes. He is sighted by Makima at a distance of 500 kilometers. The Gun Devil stops and he begins gunfire towards Makima. Makima activates her ability before she is shot by one of the bullets. He kills Aki and Makima. It is recorded that it is Makima's 29th death. To counter it, Makima activates her ability to use the contracts of [Aki Hayakawa](/wiki/Aki_Hayakawa "Aki Hayakawa"), [Tendo](/wiki/Tendo "Tendo"), [Yutaro Kurose](/wiki/Yutaro_Kurose "Yutaro Kurose") and [Akane Sawatari](/wiki/Akane_Sawatari "Akane Sawatari") and the abilities of [Spider Devil](/wiki/Spider_Devil "Spider Devil") and [Angel Devil](/wiki/Angel_Devil "Angel Devil").

However, Makima "failed" to defeat the Gun Devil. His remnants possessed the corpse of Aki Hayakawa and they become a Gun Fiend. Swiftly, the fiend moves towards Aki's residence, and arrives with a knock at the door. Denji, after being told to by Makima, opens it, and after a few short seconds, is shot in the stomach by the Gun Fiend. This attack destroys a large amount of Aki's residence and sends Denji and Power flying through the air in the direction of the attack. The Gun Fiend then engages in combat with Denji, destroying large parts of the surrounding residential area. Denji, after receiving blood and pleads from the residents of the area, then overpowers the Gun Fiend, defeating and killing it.

## Abilities

As a Devil, the Gun Devil possesses all of the standard [devil abilities](/wiki/Devil#General_Abilities "Devil"), such as the ability to make contracts with humans for a price and take over a dead human body and their consciousness, becoming a fiend.

The only contract with it seen are a contract with the President of the United States in exchange for one year from the lifespan of every citizen of the United States to kill [Makima](/wiki/Makima "Makima").[\[19\]](#cite_note-Ch75Pg12_-_13-19) This contract has been made by twenty percent of the body of the Gun Devil. However, it was not enough to kill Makima, at the end twenty percent of the Gun Devil is defeated by Makima and possessed the corpse of Aki Hayakawa, which resulted into the Gun Fiend.

As the Gun Fiend, like all other fiends, his devil ability albeit significantly weaken, and also have a distinct feature on his head. [\[20\]](#cite_note-Ch4Pg5-20)

### Physical Abilities

-   **Immense Speed**: The Gun Devil is incredibly fast, able to kill 1.2 million people in various countries across the world in five minutes.[\[21\]](#cite_note-Ch13Pg10_-_13-21) Its speed is so great that pieces of its flesh burned off of its body as it moved.[\[22\]](#cite_note-Ch13Pg15-22) After becoming the Gun Fiend, it retains its insane speed, being able to travel to Power's location and attack her after blasting Denji from the entrance of Aki’s apartment extremely quickly.[\[23\]](#cite_note-Ch77Pg16_-_17-23)

-   **Enhanced Durability:** As the Gun Devil\`s made from the guns, these extensions possess enhanced durability. After becoming the Gun Fiend, despite being in a human body, the guns in its forearm are surprisingly durable, being able to block multiple hits from Denji's chainsaw with ease.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Ch78Pg11-24)[\[25\]](#cite_note-Ch79Pg2-25)

### Devil Powers

[](/wiki/File:Gun_Devil_flesh.png)

A piece of the Gun Devil's flesh

-   **Bullet Flesh**: Due to the speed and power of the Gun Devil, whenever it moves, pieces of its own flesh (which resemble bullets) scorch off of its body and land in random areas it comes across. When devils of any type consume pieces of the Gun Devil's flesh, their power is greatly enhanced. As stated by Makima, his body is currently separated into several pieces and remains in an unconscious state. Twenty percent of his body is possessed by America, twenty-eight by the Soviet Union, eleven by China, four by other countries, and the remaining thirty-seven is held by devils around the world as flesh pieces.
    -   **Passive Regeneration:** The Gun Devil has the ability to passively regenerate itself, as small pieces of flesh from the Gun Devil are attracted to each other and will fuse together upon contact. And large enough chunks will constantly attempt to rejoin the Gun Devil's main body to regenerate.[\[22\]](#cite_note-Ch13Pg15-22)

-   **Bullet Projection**: The Gun Devil is able to fire bullets using the several guns which are parts of its body with great precision and speed. It is able to fire a bullet through the head of every adult male within approximately 1 kilometer of it, fire a bullet through the head of every child up to 12 years old within approximately 1500 meters[\[26\]](#cite_note-Ch75Pg14_-_15-26) and fire a bullet through the heart of every living thing born in January, February, March, May, June, August, September, November or December in approximately 1000 meters of himself. As a Fiend, its power is significantly weaker, however, it can still fire bullets from the gun in its left forearm and head with great precision and speed. It is able to break walls and Denji apart with ease as well as destroy multiple buildings at once.[\[27\]](#cite_note-Ch77Pg14_-_15-27)[\[28\]](#cite_note-Ch79Pg3-28)

## Trivia

-   Gun Devil's rankings in the [Popularity Polls](/wiki/Popularity_Polls "Popularity Polls") are as follows:
    -   Gun Devil ranked 53rd in the First Popularity Poll with 97 votes.
    -   Gun Devil ranked 50th in the Second Popularity Poll with 435 votes.
-   The Gun Devil couldn't kill all living things born in April, July or October. This might be a Japanese pun due the names of the first two in Japanese containing homonyms for "**death**" (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>死</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>し</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _**shi**_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")) April is **shi**gatsu, and July is **shi**chigatsu. Meanwhile, the last one contains a homonym for "**gun**" (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>銃</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>じゅう</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> , _**jū**_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")) October is **jū**gatsu.
-   The Gun Devil has been stated by the author to be a depiction of the “free country” and "gun society" aspect of the United States of America.[\[1\]](#cite_note-:0-1)

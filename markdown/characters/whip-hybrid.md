Hybrid Form

## Personality

The Whip Hybrid's real personality is currently unknown, as she was brainwashed and mind-controlled by Makima. According to the Second Popularity Poll, she is rather arrogant and high-handed. This is shown with her blunt response to the Spear Hybrid's proposal of competing for a date with Makima, and cackling when striking Chainsaw Man with her whips.

## Plot

### [Control Devil arc](/control-devil-arc "Control Devil arc")

At an unknown point in time, the Whip Hybrid was brainwashed by Makima to serve her needs. She is summoned as part of Makima's newly-formed [Special Division 5](/tokyo-special-division-5 "Tokyo Special Division 5"), a team of weapon hybrids created for the sole purpose of battling the fully-powered [Chainsaw Devil](/chainsaw-devil "Chainsaw Devil").[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch86Pg14-15-1) While under Makima's control, the Whip Hybrid tells the [Spear Hybrid](/spear-hybrid "Spear Hybrid") that trying to win Makima's affection will only bring him misery.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch86Pg17-2)

Once Makima commands Special Division 5 to attack, each member activates their weapon trigger, transforming into their Hybrid forms. They all leap from their respective spots to lunge straight towards Chainsaw Man. Before any of the Hybrids can land a single blow on him, they are all blown back by Chainsaw Man leaping forward from the building he stood on to initiate the fight.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch87Pg4-9-3)

The Whip Hybrid later attacks Chainsaw Man from behind using a whiplash, after he escapes being engulfed in an explosion caused by the [Flamethrower Hybrid](/flamethrower-hybrid "Flamethrower Hybrid"). However, their skirmish is interrupted by [Reze](/reze "Reze") blasting her way through the building they're standing on to snatch Chainsaw Man away.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch88Pg3-4-4) She is eventually torn to shreds alongside the remaining Special Division 5 members after Chainsaw Man withstands their combined attack of sending him into space.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch88Pg5-17-5)

At some point in the future, Special Division 5's Hybrids are revived once more by Makima, who brings them all to a graveyard to confront Denji.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch93Pg12-13-6) Once Makima finishes monologuing her thoughts of erasing anything she dislikes to Pochita (who is disguised as Denji), the Whip Hybrid and the other Weapon Humans transform into their Hybrid forms for the final battle.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch93Pg18-19-7)

During this confrontation, the Whip Hybrid and Reze attempt to attack Pochita from both sides after he is impaled by the Spear Hybrid. However, Pochita retaliates by using a spinning aerial slash to take down the three Hybrids, who all fall to the ground defeated.[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch94Pg8-9-8)

## Trivia

-   The Whip Hybrid's rankings in the [Popularity Polls](/popularity-polls "Popularity Polls") are as follows:
    -   The Whip Hybrid ranked 49th in the Second Popularity Poll with 464 votes.
-   Despite having slightly dark brown hair when colored, she oddly lacked the [screentoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screentone) that is used for characters of that shade which lead to confusion on her hair color.

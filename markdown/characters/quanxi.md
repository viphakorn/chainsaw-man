## Appearance

### Human Form

Quanxi is a tall woman with cream hair tied back in a ponytail. She wears an eye patch over her right eye and has a brown left eye. She is also seen wearing a black tank top tucked into a high-waist pants with a large belt during her mission to retrieve [Denji](/denji "Denji")'s heart.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Ch54Pg8-1)

When in combat Quanxi dons a set of sheathes on her back, holding up to three swords which resemble [Dao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dao_(Chinese_sword) "wikipedia:Dao (Chinese sword)").[\[2\]](#cite_note-Ch60Pg6_-_17-2)

### Hybrid Form

In her transformed state, Quanxi's teeth sharpen along her head, transforming into hardened arrows with wide curved horns taking the shape of a bow on the side of her head. Arrowheads stick out of her neck while her forearms grow glove-like flesh with sharpened bow-shaped attachments on them.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Ch67Pg12_-_13-3)

![Hybrid Form](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/chainsaw-man/images/2/2a/Quanxi_hybrid_form.png "Quanxi hybrid form.png")

Hybrid Form

## Personality

Quanxi is calm and stoic, having no shame in discussing business while she's in bed with her harem of fiends, showing little emotion even as her girlfriends fawn over her.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Ch54Pg8_-_11-4) However, she does deeply care for her fiends, making her one request for a reward to be that they are given human rights and a basic education, and not attacking them even after they have been turned into dolls at the cost of her own safety.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Ch54Pg11-5)

Quanxi is ruthlessly pragmatic in combat, preferring to throw her enemies outside of the battlefield in order to efficiently cut down their numbers and remove distractions.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ch62Pg1_-_2-6)[\[7\]](#cite_note-Ch62Pg4_-_7-7)[\[8\]](#cite_note-Ch63Pg7_-_9-8) Similarly, after being cast into [Hell](/hell "Hell"), she instantly requested a ceasefire in hostilities so as to determine their situation. This alliance continued until the moment the threat was contained, at which point she immediately attacked once again. Though her attacks are swift and brutal, she can at times choose to leave those other than her target alive, as highlighted when she knocked [Aki](/aki-hayakawa "Aki Hayakawa") and [Angel Devil](/angel-devil "Angel Devil") unconscious and offered to spare [Power](/power "Power")'s life. At other times she did slice through some devil hunters, hired to protect Denji, that weren’t her target.

Quanxi seems to have a past amongst the bureau, being referred to by [Santa Claus](/santa-claus "Santa Claus") as the 'First Devil Hunter'. This suggestion is furthered by her conversation with [Kishibe](/kishibe "Kishibe"), which hinted at a past friendship between the two.

## Abilities

### Physical Prowess

-   **Enhanced Strength**: Quanxi possesses a level of strength having been described by [Hirofumi Yoshida](/hirofumi-yoshida "Hirofumi Yoshida") as being beyond what is humanly capable.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Ch62Pg15-9) When wielding swords, she can cut through dozens of humans and dolls without slowing down and only stopped once her weapons were destroyed by the force of her own attacks.[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch60Pg8_-_17-10) Even a blocked strike was enough to knock out both [Aki](/aki-hayakawa "Aki Hayakawa") and [Angel](/angel-devil "Angel Devil").
-   **Enhanced Speed**: Even in her human form, Quanxi possesses superhuman speed. She could disappear from the sights of five devil hunters by blitzing past them while cutting through an army of dolls created by the [Doll Devil](/doll-devil "Doll Devil"), before the original five devil hunters realized they had already been killed.[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch60Pg8_-_17-10)
-   **Enhanced Reflexes**: Quanxi has superhuman reflexes, her time perception can keep up with her own superhuman speed. She can also dodge attacks rapidly and even stop a moving knife with her fingers.

### Hybrid Powers

-   **Hybrid Transformation**: By pulling an arrow out of her right eye socket, Quanxi can transform into a hybrid with many arrows and spikes emerging from her arms and head.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Ch67Pg9_-_13-11)
    -   **Arrow Shooting**: In her Hybrid form, Quanxi is equipped with crossbows in her arms which can shoot several arrows at her targets. These arrows are shown to be quite powerful as they are able to tear perfectly circular holes into whatever Quanxi shoots. She can also use this ability to defeat enemies from close range by firing a buckshot to wipe out a group of enemies quickly.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Ch67Pg9_-_13-11)

-   **Blood Consumption**: As a hybrid, Quanxi is able to heal wounds by consuming blood,[\[12\]](#cite_note-Ch50Pg2_-_4-12) regenerating her entire body from just a head.
    -   **Nigh-Immortality**: Due to being a hybrid, Quanxi is immortal and nearly unkillable. Despite likely being over 50 years old, Quanxi still looks the same way she did 30 years ago. Even if she dies, as long as someone pulls her arrow, Quanxi can come back to life in perfect condition.

### Skillset

-   **Bilingual**: Quanxi has demonstrated the ability to speak both Japanese and Chinese.[\[13\]](#cite_note-Ch60Pg7-13)[\[14\]](#cite_note-Ch61Pg15-14)
-   **Hand-to-Hand Combat**: Quanxi is a skilled fighter in hand-to-hand combat, with Kishibe considering her to be one of the best in the world.[\[15\]](#cite_note-Ch54Pg12-15) She is highly specialized in using kicks, within a matter of moments she could disable Denji, Tamaoki and Kusakabe using nothing but kicks.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Ch61Pg5_-_10-16)
-   **Swordsmanship**: Quanxi wields multiple blades in combat, swapping them out as they're destroyed by the force of her own attacks. Combined with her high speed she can cut through entire crowds of enemies at once.[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ch60Pg8_-_17-10)

## Trivia

-   Quanxi's rankings in the [Popularity Polls](/popularity-polls "Popularity Polls") are as follows:
    -   Quanxi ranked 14th in the First Popularity Poll with 4,253 votes.
    -   Quanxi ranked 11th in the Second Popularity Poll with 18,801 votes.
-   Quanxi's decapitation of all devil hunters and dolls at high speed is a reference to **Kirisuke and Johnny, The Slaying of 499** (<ruby lang="ja"><rb>斬</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>き</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> り<ruby lang="ja"><rb>介</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>すけ</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> とジョニー<ruby lang="ja"><rb>四</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>よん</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>百</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ひゃく</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>九</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>きゅう</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>十</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>じゅう</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>九</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>きゅう</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>人</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>ひと</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> <ruby lang="ja"><rb>斬</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>き</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby> り, _Kirisuke to Jonī Yonhyaku Kyūjūkyū Hitokiri_[?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "wikipedia:Help:Installing Japanese character sets")) which is also mentioned by [Tatsuki Fujimoto](/tatsuki-fujimoto "Tatsuki Fujimoto").[\[17\]](#cite_note-Ch60-17)
-   "Quanxi" is actually an incorrect romanization, since according to Hànyǔ Pīnyīn, that would be pronounced "Chuen-s(h)ee"[\[Note 1\]](#cite_note-18) instead of "Kwan-shee". In the Mandarin translation, her name is written as 光熙 (_Guāngxī_), which is closer to the original Japanese pronunciation. The Chinese characters that comprise her name mean "light" and "prosperous" respectively.
    -   Her name is actually an unusual Chinese name, with its last usage being over 1,700+ years ago\[_citation needed_\], but it is not impossible for people to have uncommon names either, adding to the vagueness of her age.
-   Her status as a "first devil hunter" might imply that hybrids age incredibly slowly, if not at all, though this is unconfirmed due to her age never being specified.
-   Given the ambiguity of her age it is also unknown if “first devil hunter” refers to a modern version of a profession or not, like the difference between an ancient warrior compared to a modern soldier or a caveman hunting compared to a more “professional” and organized modern human hunting for example.
-   The name of her fused devil, “Crossbow Devil”, is conjectural and is never confirmed what it’s real name is in the manga. There have been other unofficial names given to the devil, such as Bow and Arrow or just Arrow, but the name Crossbow stuck the most due to the shape of its horns and how crossbows specifically originate from China.
-   In contrast to how Denji is most publicly known as his role as the Chainsaw Man, most people seem to only know Quanxi as a freakishly strong and fast human and not a hybrid or devil of any kind. The Chainsaw Man is revered as a public figure who is a friendly devil who fights devils but Quanxi is often feared as a deadly mysterious assassin human who has scary abilities for a “human” and hunts devils. It seems to be implied she mostly fights in her human form and enters her hybrid form rarely. It is unknown how many people know of her secret aside from her fiends.
    -   She seems to be the only hybrid who has hybrid abilities like speed and strength in “human” form.
